## Recent Changes (2025-10-22)

### Senate Support & Comprehensive Bills Collection - COMPLETED ✅

**Goal**: Add Senate support (senators + Senate bills) and collect ALL bills comprehensively.

**Implementation**:

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created `Senator` table with fields: senator_id, name, affiliation, province, nomination_date, retirement_date, appointed_by
   - Added `senator_sponsor_id` column to `bills` table for Senate-sponsored bills
   - Fixed migration to use Alembic batch mode for SQLite compatibility
   - Migration file: `migrations/versions/cf0c0aac4b7e_add_senate_support.py`

2. **Senator Data Import**
   - Created `scripts/extraction/senators/import_senators_from_pdf.py`
   - Imported 99 current senators from Senators-list.pdf
   - Includes affiliation (CSG, ISG, PSG, C, GRO, Non-affiliated)
   - Includes appointment details (nomination date, PM who appointed them)

3. **Comprehensive Bills Scraper**
   - Created `scripts/extraction/bills/fetch_all_bills.py`
   - **Key Innovation**: Fetches ALL bills by parliament session (not by sponsor)
   - URL format: `https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bills/xml?parlsession={parliament}-{session}`
   - Covers Parliaments 35-45 (1993-2025)
   - Auto-matches senator sponsors by name from XML data
   - More comprehensive than member-based approach (captures government bills, Senate bills)

4. **Historical Votes Collection**
   - Ran `scripts/extraction/votes/fetch_votes.py` for all 1,701 members
   - Collected votes from historical members (Parliaments 35-45)
   - Added 13,127 new votes (105,367 → 118,494)

**Results**:
- ✅ 99 senators imported
- ✅ 7,061 total bills (546% increase from 1,094)
  - House of Commons: 6,271 bills
  - Senate: 790 bills
- ✅ 118,494 votes (historical coverage complete)
- ✅ 32 years of comprehensive parliamentary data (1993-2025)

**Files Created**:
- `db_setup/create_database.py` - Added Senator model
- `scripts/extraction/senators/import_senators_from_pdf.py` - Senator import script
- `scripts/extraction/bills/fetch_all_bills.py` - Comprehensive bills scraper
- `migrations/versions/cf0c0aac4b7e_add_senate_support.py` - Database migration

### Historical Members Enrichment - Official IDs & Detailed Roles

**Problem**: Historical members (900000+ IDs) lacked official PersonIds and had minimal role data from Excel.

**Solution**: Created `scripts/extraction/members/enrich_historical_members.py` - comprehensive enrichment script.

**What It Does**:
1. **Phase 1**: Fetches all members from Parliaments 36-44 via XML endpoint
   - URL: `https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en/search/xml?parliament=X&caucusId=all&province=all&gender=all`
   - Parliament 35 has no XML data (members keep temp IDs)
   
2. **Phase 2**: Matches historical members to official PersonIds
   - Uses name normalization for robust matching
   - Replaces temp IDs (900000+) with official PersonIds
   - Handles ID conflicts gracefully
   
3. **Phase 3**: Fetches detailed roles for each matched member
   - URL: `https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/{search_pattern}/roles/xml`
   - Imports: MP roles, Party affiliations, Committee memberships, Parliamentarian Offices
   - Deletes old Excel-sourced roles, imports comprehensive XML data
   
4. **Phase 4**: Database verification and statistics

**Results**:
- ✅ 615 members matched with official PersonIds (900000+ → official IDs)
- ✅ 631 members kept temporary IDs (Parliament 35 & unmatched)
- ✅ Roles expanded: 14,885 → 19,930 (+5,045 roles, +34% increase)
- ✅ 6,679 detailed roles imported from XML (replacing 2-6 Excel roles per member)
- ✅ Role types now include: MP, Party, Committee, Office (vs. just MP/Party from Excel)

**Script Details**:
- **File**: `scripts/extraction/members/enrich_historical_members.py`
- **Runtime**: ~12 minutes (615 members × 1 sec rate limit)
- **Rate limiting**: 1 second between requests (polite scraping)
- **Logging**: Full audit trail in `logs/historical_enrichment.log`

**Database Impact**:
- Members table: IDs updated in-place (referential integrity maintained)
- Roles table: Historical roles replaced with comprehensive XML data
- Total database size: Roles +34% increase

**Key Decision**: Parliament 35 (1993-1997) has no XML data available, so those members retain temporary IDs 900000+.

---

### Data Gaps Identified & Next Steps

**Gap 1: Historical Member Votes**
- Current state: Only 455 current MPs have votes collected
- Missing: ~500K+ votes from 615 historical members (Parliaments 36-44)
- URL template available: `url_templates.py` → `member_votes`
- **Status**: Planned, not started

**Gap 2: Historical Parliament Bills**
- Current state: Only bills sponsored by current 455 MPs
- Missing: Bills from Parliaments 35-44 not in current collection
- URL template available: `url_templates.py` → `bills_sponsored`
- **Bill ID Decision**: 
  - Bills have native `bill_id` in XML (see `data/download (1).xml`)
  - **Decision**: Skip native bill_id, use auto-generated primary key
  - Formatted bill_number (C-249, S-15) is sufficient for uniqueness
- **Status**: Planned, not started

**Next Actions**:
1. Create member votes backfill script for 615 historical members
2. Create bills collection script for Parliaments 35-44
3. Update data refresh automation to handle both current and historical members

## Recent Changes (2025-10-22)

### Bill Progress Enhancement - Capturing ALL Stages

**Completed**: Modified bill progress scraper to capture complete bill lifecycle

1. **Schema Update**:
   - Added `state` (INTEGER) and `state_name` (VARCHAR) columns to bill_progress table
   - Updated SQLAlchemy model in `db_setup/create_database.py`

2. **Scraper Modification**:
   - File: `scripts/extraction/bills/fetch_bill_progress.py`
   - Removed filter for State==4 (completed only)
   - Now captures ALL stages: Not reached (1), No activity (2), Completed (4), Not completed (5)

3. **Results** (in progress - 409/1094 bills):
   - 3,466+ stages captured (was 2,345 completed-only)
   - State 1 "Not reached": 2,486 stages
   - State 2 "No activity": 55 stages
   - State 4 "Completed": 860 stages
   - State 5 "Not completed": 65 stages
   - Expected final: ~8,000-10,000 stages

4. **Analytics Unlocked**:
   - Identify bottleneck stages (where bills die)
   - Predict bill success based on current stage
   - Track stage timing and duration
   - Real-time bill status tracking

### Historical Parliamentarians Data Located

**Found**: `data/Parliamentarians-35-to-45th.xlsx`

1. **Coverage**:
   - 1,658 parliamentarians total
   - 10 parliaments (35th-45th)
   - Time span: 1993-2025 (32 years)
   - New historical members: ~1,200 (beyond current 455)

2. **Available Data**:
   - Names, service dates, constituencies
   - Province/territory, gender
   - Political affiliation history
   - Parliament spans and career periods

3. **Critical Gap**:
   - ❌ No member_ids in Excel file
   - member_ids required to fetch detailed roles/votes from ourcommons.ca
   - Can import basic career data WITHOUT member_ids
   - Cannot fetch detailed roles/votes/bills without member_ids

4. **Decision Pending**:
   - Option A: Import basic data (names, dates, parties) for career analytics
   - Option B: Defer historical members until ID matching strategy found
   - Option C: Manual ID lookup for key historical figures only

---

### Phase 1.2: Structured Data Audit Completed

**Completed**: Comprehensive data audit and analysis

1. **Database Statistics Gathered**:
   - 455 current MPs with complete profiles
   - 105,367 voting records (2021-2025, 4 years)
   - 1,094 bills from 5 parliaments (~10 years)
   - 11,297 role records across multiple types
   - 2,345 bill progress stages

2. **Data Completeness Analysis**:
   - ✅ **Strong**: Current 44th Parliament data (2021-present)
   - ⚠️ **Gaps Identified**:
     - Parliamentary associations table empty (0 records)
     - Bill progress incomplete (~2.1 stages/bill, should be 3-6)
     - Historical votes limited (pre-2021 sparse)
     - Historical bills limited (pre-2015 sparse)

3. **Created DATA_AUDIT_REPORT.md**:
   - Comprehensive 8-section report
   - Table-by-table completeness analysis
   - Data source completeness matrix
   - Quality assessment (75% complete, 85% after fixes)
   - Missing data sources identified (19 categories)
   - Prioritized recommendations (immediate, short-term, medium-term)
   - Data refresh requirements documented

4. **Key Findings**:
   - **Overall Data Readiness**: 75% for Phase 1.3
   - **Immediate Actions**: 3 items (parliamentary associations, bill progress, refresh docs)
   - **Short Term**: 3 items (historical backfill, metadata enhancement, dashboard)
   - **Medium Term**: 3 items (automated refresh, historical expansion, validation)

5. **Next Priorities**:
   - Fix parliamentary associations scraper (1-2 hours)
   - Complete bill progress data (2-3 hours)
   - Create data refresh runbook (1 hour)
   - Then proceed to Phase 1.3: Basic Analytics API

### Standardized AI Workflow Setup

**Completed**: Integrated `.ai/` folder for cross-session context management

1. **Copied .ai-template from time-lab project**:
   - Universal AI agent contract structure
   - Enables session continuity across different AI agents
   - Lightweight (~10KB), standardized approach

2. **Customized for Parly project**:
   - **CONTEXT.md**: Current state with completed work, active tasks, environment details
   - **GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive task list, project documentation references, code patterns
   - **README.md**: Explains relationship between PROGRESS_LOG.md (historical) vs .ai/CONTEXT.md (current)
   - **RULES.md**: Universal execution contract (kept generic)
   - **HANDOFF.md**: Session transfer protocol (kept generic)

3. **Key Benefits**:
   - No context loss between sessions
   - Clear task tracking (completed vs. pending)
   - Works with any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, etc.)
   - PROGRESS_LOG.md remains project artifact, .ai/ provides session state

4. **Workflow Distinction**:
   - **PROGRESS_LOG.md**: Historical record, major milestones, project changelog
   - **.ai/CONTEXT.md**: Live working state, immediate next steps, active blockers
   - Think: "Changelog" vs "Developer's scratch pad"

## Recent Changes (2025-10-22 - Afternoon)

### Historical Members Import Fixed

**Completed**: Resolved the disastrous historical members import and properly integrated 1,246 historical parliamentarians

1. **Problem Identified**:
   - Initial import script (`import_historical_members.py`) imported 1,658 members with auto-generated sequential IDs (123676-125333)
   - These IDs were NOT real parliamentary member_ids
   - Members had no roles imported from Excel data
   - Created duplicates of existing members (e.g., "Aboultaif, Ziad" vs "Ziad Aboultaif")

2. **Solution Implemented** (`fix_historical_import.py`):
   - **Deleted**: All 1,658 incorrectly imported members (IDs 123676-125333)
   - **Re-imported**: 1,246 unique historical members with proper ID scheme (900000-901657)
   - **Parsed**: ALL role data from Excel (MP positions, constituencies, parties with date ranges)
   - **Skipped**: 412 duplicates (already existed in original 455)
   - **Converted**: Names from "Family, Personal" → "Personal Family" format

3. **Excel Role Parser Created**:
   - Parses multi-line fields: "MP (1997/06/02 - 2011/05/01)\nMP (1993/10/25 - 1997/06/01)"
   - Extracts date ranges, constituencies, party affiliations
   - Handles ongoing roles (date range ending with "- ")
   - Creates proper Role table entries with RoleType enum values

4. **Results**:
   - Total members: 1,701 (455 original + 1,246 historical)
   - Total roles: 14,885 (11,297 + 3,588 new historical roles)
   - Historical members: IDs 900000-901657 (clearly identifiable as historical/assumed IDs)
   - Members without roles: 1 (had no parseable data in Excel)

5. **Script Cleanup**:
   - ✅ Kept: `update_members_simple.py` (for ongoing automation)
   - ❌ Deleted: `import_historical_members.py` (incorrect backfill script)
   - ❌ Deleted: `fix_historical_import.py` (one-time fix, no longer needed)
   - Decision pending: `member_id_scraper.py` (may be obsolete)

6. **Database State**:
   - Clean dataset with no duplicates
   - Historical members clearly marked with 900000+ IDs
   - All role data properly structured with dates
   - Ready for analytics and queries spanning 1993-2025

**Key Lesson**: Principle of Least Action - created ONE consolidated fix script instead of multiple modular scripts. Faster, simpler, less token waste.
