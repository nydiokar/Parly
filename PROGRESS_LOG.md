# Parly Project Progress Log

## Purpose
This file tracks the current state of the Parly project, all changes made during implementation, and deviations from the initial state. It serves as a delta tracker to measure progress and maintain awareness of system modifications.

## Key Metrics

### Database Population Status
| Table | Target Rows | Current Rows | Status |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| members | ~338 | 455 | ‚úÖ POPULATED (135% - includes 2025 election) |
| roles | ~15,000+ | 11,297 | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY POPULATED (75% - historical complete) |
| votes | ~50,000+ | 0 | ‚ùå Not populated |
| bills | ~1,000+ | 0 | ‚ùå Not populated |
| bill_progress | ~5,000+ | 0 | ‚ùå Not populated |

**Note**: Member count exceeds original estimate due to 2025 election (119 new members). Role count lower than target because target was estimated for full historical depth across all parliaments.

### Script Completion Status
| Script | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| member_id_scraper.py | ‚úÖ Complete | Output: member_ids.csv (338 members - historical) |
| scrape_roles.py | ‚úÖ Complete | Uses XML endpoint, extracts member names |
| update_members_simple.py | ‚úÖ Complete | Incremental member updates (added 119 new) |
| fetch_votes.py | ‚ùå Incomplete | Needs rewrite using XML pattern |
| fetch_bills.py | ‚ùå Missing | Needs creation |
| fetch_bill_progress.py | ‚ùå Missing | Needs creation |

### API Development Status

## Pipeline Architecture Analysis

### How Roles Were Obtained: Before vs After

**BEFORE (Initial Historical Data Collection):**
1. `member_id_scraper.py` scraped member list ‚Üí `data/member_ids.csv` (338 members with names, IDs, search patterns)
2. `scrape_roles.py` (old version) used **HTML scraping** with BeautifulSoup
   - Fetched HTML pages for each member
   - Did NOT extract member names from source
   - Output: `data/member_roles.json` with roles but **no member_name field**
3. `insert_roles_db.py` merged CSV names + JSON roles during DB insertion
   - Used CSV as source of truth for member names
   - Inefficient: 336 individual commits
   - No duplicate prevention

**AFTER (Current XML-Based System):**
1. `member_id_scraper.py` - unchanged (still works for initial bootstrap)
2. `scrape_roles.py` (rewritten) uses **XML parsing**
   - Fetches `/roles/xml` endpoint (structured data)
   - Extracts `PersonOfficialFirstName` + `PersonOfficialLastName` from XML
   - Output: `data/member_roles.json` **with member_name field included**
   - Proven, reliable pattern
3. `update_members_simple.py` (new) - incremental updates
   - Fetches `/search/xml` to get current member list
   - Compares with database to find missing members
   - Reuses `fetch_member_roles_xml()` and `parse_roles_xml()` from scrape_roles.py
   - Inserts directly to database (no intermediate JSON)
   - Has duplicate prevention
   - Batch commits per member

### Why the Scrape Logic Changes Were Necessary

**Root Cause**: HTML scraping was fragile and didn't capture member names from source

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **scrape_roles.py**: Switched to XML endpoint which has structured `PersonOfficialFirstName/LastName` fields
2. **insert_roles_db.py**: Added backward compatibility (CSV fallback) so old JSON still works
3. **update_members_simple.py**: Built on proven XML pattern, reuses functions instead of rewriting

**Result**: Now we have a consistent, reliable pipeline that:
- Uses official XML endpoints (not HTML scraping)
- Extracts all data from source (no external CSV dependency for names)
- Has duplicate prevention (can be run multiple times safely)
- Is incremental (only adds what's missing)

### Is the Outlined Plan Still Valid?

**YES**, the implementation plan remains valid with one key enhancement:

**Original Plan**:
1. Phase 1: Data Foundation (members/roles/votes/bills/bill_progress)
2. Phase 2: API Layer (FastAPI)
3. Phase 3: Refinement (tests, orchestration)

**What We Learned**:
- ‚úÖ The **XML endpoint pattern is proven and should be used for ALL scrapers**
- ‚úÖ The **incremental update pattern works perfectly** (compare DB vs source, add missing)
- ‚úÖ **Historical data can be preserved** while adding new data incrementally
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate prevention is critical** and must be in all insertion scripts

**Adjustments Needed**:
1. `fetch_votes.py` should follow the SAME pattern:
   - Use XML endpoint from ourcommons.ca
   - Compare existing votes in DB vs available votes
   - Insert only missing votes
   - Include duplicate prevention

2. `fetch_bills.py` and `fetch_bill_progress.py` should follow same pattern:
   - Use XML/JSON endpoints from parl.ca
   - Incremental loading (check what exists, add what's missing)
   - Duplicate prevention

3. All future scrapers should be **incremental by design**, not full replacement

**Plan Validation**: The core architecture is solid. We now have a proven template:
```
1. Fetch list from XML endpoint
2. Query database for existing records
3. Calculate delta (what's missing)
4. For each missing item:
   - Fetch detailed XML
   - Parse structured data
   - Insert with duplicate check
   - Commit incrementally
5. Report results
```

### Next Steps (In Order)

**Immediate Next**:
1. Rewrite `fetch_votes.py` using proven XML pattern from update_members_simple.py
2. Create `fetch_bills.py` using same pattern
3. Create `fetch_bill_progress.py` using same pattern
4. Verify all data populated correctly

**Then**:
5. Build FastAPI layer (can proceed once data is populated)
6. Add tests
7. Create orchestration script

**Estimated Time Remaining**:
- Votes scraper: 1-2 hours (rewrite using template)
- Bills scraper: 1-2 hours (new, but following template)
- Bill progress scraper: 1-2 hours (new, but following template)
- API layer: 3-4 hours (original estimate still valid)
- Testing & orchestration: 2-3 hours (original estimate still valid)

**Total**: ~10-14 hours remaining (vs original 9-13 hour estimate)

The project is **18% complete** by success criteria, but the hardest architectural decisions are now resolved. The remaining work follows a proven pattern.
