## Recent Changes (2025-10-21)

### Data Extraction
1. **Completed all scrapers** using production-grade template:
   - Votes: 105,367 records from 455 members
   - Bills: 1,094 bills from multiple parliaments
   - Bill Progress: 5,636 legislative stages tracked

2. **Production features implemented**:
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Checkpointing for resume capability
   - Duplicate prevention
   - Structured logging
   - Rate limiting for polite scraping

### API Development
1. **Created complete REST API**:
   - Database connection with pooling (api/database.py)
   - Pydantic models for validation (api/models.py)
   - Three main route modules (members, votes, bills)
   - Statistics and health check endpoints
   - CORS middleware for web clients

2. **Key endpoints**:
   - `GET /members/` - List members with pagination/filtering
   - `GET /votes/` - Query votes with filters
   - `GET /bills/` - Browse bills with search
   - `GET /stats` - Database statistics
   - Full CRUD operations on all entities

### Project Setup
1. **Modernized Python project**:
   - Created pyproject.toml (modern standard)
   - Removed old requirements.txt
   - Added development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)
   - Configured linting and testing

2. **Created PROJECT_IMPROVEMENTS.md**:
   - Analysis of current state
   - Identified schema issues
   - Prioritized improvements
   - Best practices documentation

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review PROJECT_IMPROVEMENTS.md for schema refactoring recommendations
2. Add basic API tests
3. Create setup documentation

### Short Term
4. Refactor vote schema (separate aggregate votes from member votes)
5. Add configuration management (config.py)
6. Implement database migrations (Alembic)

### Medium Term
7. Add API authentication if needed
8. Performance optimization (caching, query optimization)
9. Deploy to production environment
