# Parly - Parliamentary Data Analysis Framework

## Project Status: Archived

> **Note:** This project has been archived and will be reimplemented as a specialized agent within the MAX or Kanebra frameworks.

## Vision

Parly was designed to be an LLM-powered expert system focused on parliamentary dynamics, capable of analyzing debates, member interactions, voting patterns, and sentiment profiles within legislative bodies. The system aimed to provide deep insights into governance processes through automated data collection, analysis, and AI-driven interpretation.

## Planned Capabilities

- **Automated parliamentary data extraction** from official websites, APIs, and XML sources
- **Member profile analysis** including roles, voting patterns, and speech sentiment
- **Debate transcript processing** with topic modeling and trend identification
- **Cross-session tracking** of member positions on issues over time
- **LLM-powered insight generation** using retrieval-augmented generation techniques
- **Advanced query interface** for complex questions about parliamentary activities

## Technical Architecture (Planned)

Parly was designed with a modular architecture:

1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Member data scraping (basic information, roles, contacts)
   - Chamber interventions and Hansard collection
   - Automated XML processing pipelines

2. **Data Storage & Indexing Module**
   - SQL/NoSQL database for structured parliamentary data
   - Efficient indexing system for rapid data retrieval

3. **Data Processing Module**
   - Text cleaning and normalization for parliamentary language
   - Named entity recognition for member references
   - Tokenization for LLM consumption

4. **LLM Fine-Tuning Module**
   - Training dataset preparation from parliamentary records
   - Fine-tuning pipeline for domain-specific knowledge
   - Parameter-efficient tuning techniques

5. **Query & Response Module**
   - Natural language query interface
   - Retrieval-augmented generation for factual responses
   - Citation of source materials for transparency

6. **Evaluation & Improvement Module**
   - Quality metrics for response accuracy and relevance
   - User feedback integration system
   - Continuous improvement pipeline

## Future Implementation

The core concepts of Parly will be reimagined and implemented as a specialized agent within one of our active frameworks:

- **As a MAX agent:** A dedicated reasoning module within the Multi-Agent Extensible System for processing legislative data and parliamentary analysis
- **As a Kanebra feature:** A specialized capability within our Discord/CLI bot framework for political analysis and governance insights

## Lessons Learned

Developing the Parly concept provided valuable insights into:

- The complexity of processing semi-structured legislative data
- The importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for specialized knowledge domains
- The need for modular design in AI systems dealing with complex governance analysis
