## Completed

- [x] Database schema implementation (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] All data extraction scrapers (members, roles, votes, bills, bill progress)
- [x] Complete FastAPI REST API with all endpoints
- [x] Database fully populated (455 members, 11K+ roles, 105K+ votes, 1K+ bills)
- [x] Schema compatibility fixes - API models match database
- [x] Comprehensive API testing suite (25/25 tests passing)
- [x] Database schema documentation
- [x] Project roadmap to AI-powered intelligence
- [x] Modern dependency management (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Standardized .ai/ workflow setup (cross-session context management)

## Active

**Current Task**: Phase 1.2 - Structured Data Audit & Expansion

- [ ] Audit current data sources and completeness
- [ ] Identify missing structured data sources
- [ ] Document data refresh/update processes

---

## Next

Following completion of .ai/ setup, Phase 1 work begins:
1. Structured data audit - verify completeness and identify additional sources
2. Basic analytics API - statistics, trends, and correlations
3. Early LLM integration - natural language queries on structured data
4. Vote schema refactoring (DEFERRED - current structure works fine)

---

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11 (with WSL2 available)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (REST API)
- **Database**: SQLite 3
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Package Manager**: pip with pyproject.toml
- **Testing**: pytest (25/25 tests passing)

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics
- Members: 455 records
- Roles: 11,297 records
- Votes: 105,367 records
- Bills: 1,094 records
- Bill Progress: 5,636 records
