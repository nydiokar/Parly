# Current State

**Project**: Parly - Parliamentary Data API
**Goal**: Build AI-powered parliamentary intelligence system for Canadian parliamentary data
**Status**: Phase 1 - Data Foundation Complete (with historical data)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22 15:30 UTC
**Updated By**: Claude Sonnet 4.5

- [x] Complete FastAPI REST API with all endpoints
- [x] Database fully populated (455 members, 11K+ roles, 105K+ votes, 1K+ bills)
- [x] Schema compatibility fixes - API models match database
- [x] Comprehensive API testing suite (25/25 tests passing)
- [x] Database schema documentation
- [x] Project roadmap to AI-powered intelligence
- [x] Modern dependency management (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Standardized .ai/ workflow setup (cross-session context management)
- [x] Data audit completed (docs/DATA_AUDIT_REPORT.md)
- [x] Historical members import (1,246 members from 1993-2025)
- [x] Historical roles parsed from Excel (3,588 role entries with dates)

## Active

**Current Task**: Historical Members Enriched with Official IDs - Data Expansion Planning

- [x] Historical members enriched with official PersonIds (615 members matched)
- [x] Detailed roles imported from XML (6,679 roles: MP, Party, Committee, Office)
- [x] ID mapping: 900000+ temp IDs replaced with official IDs where available
- [x] 631 members still have temporary IDs (Parliament 35 & unmatched members)
- [ ] **NEXT**: Expand data collection for historical members (votes, bills)

## Next

### Data Expansion for Historical Members (Parliaments 35-44)

1. **Member Votes Collection**
   - Fetch votes for all 615 newly enriched historical members with official IDs
   - Use URL template: `member_votes` from `url_templates.py`
   - Target: ~500K+ historical votes (1993-2021)
   - **Status**: Planned - Not started

2. **Bills Collection for Historical Parliaments**
   - Current bills only cover members initially in DB (455 current MPs)
   - Need to fetch bills from Parliaments 35-44 comprehensively
   - Use URL template: `bills_sponsored` from `url_templates.py`
   - **Bill ID Strategy Decision**: Use auto-generated IDs + formatted bill_number (e.g., "C-249")
     - Bills have native `bill_id` in XML (see `download (1).xml`)
     - **Decision**: Skip native bill_id mapping, use auto-incremented primary key
     - Formatted bill_number (C-249, S-15, etc.) is sufficient for uniqueness
   - **Status**: Planned - Not started

3. **Data Refresh Automation**
   - Implement daily/weekly scrapers for new data
   - Monitor for new members, votes, bills
   - **Status**: Deferred until historical backfill complete

4. **Analytics API (Phase 1.3)**
   - Member activity metrics
   - Voting patterns analysis
   - Bill sponsorship trends
   - **Status**: Deferred until data expansion complete

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics (as of 2025-10-22 - After Enrichment)
- Members: 1,701 records
  - 1,070 with official PersonIds (< 900000)
  - 631 with temporary IDs (>= 900000) - Parliament 35 & unmatched
- Roles: 19,930 records
  - Massive expansion from 14,885 → 19,930 (+5,045 roles)
  - Includes: MP roles, Party affiliations, Committee memberships, Parliamentarian Offices
- Votes: 105,367 records (2021-2025, current MPs only)
  - **GAP**: Missing ~500K+ votes from historical members (Parliaments 35-44)
- Bills: 1,094 records (sponsor-based collection, current MPs only)
  - **GAP**: Missing bills from Parliaments 35-44 not sponsored by current MPs
- Bill Progress: 5,636 records (all stages captured for collected bills)

### Data Audit Findings (Updated 2025-10-22 - Post Enrichment)
- ✅ Historical members enriched with official PersonIds (615 matched, 631 unmatched)
- ✅ Historical roles expanded: 3,588 → 19,930 total roles (+434% increase)
- ✅ Detailed role types now captured: MP, Party, Committee, Office
- ⚠️ **Data Gaps Identified**:
  - Historical member votes not collected (only current 455 MPs have votes)
  - Historical parliament bills incomplete (only bills from current MPs)
- ✅ Data spans: 1993-2025 (32 years of parliamentary history for members/roles)
- ⚠️ Vote/Bill data spans: 2021-2025 (only 4 years, needs 1993-2021 backfill)
