## Next

### Phase 1.3: Analytics API (READY TO START)

1. **Member Activity Metrics**
   - Vote participation rates
   - Bill sponsorship statistics
   - Committee involvement tracking
   - Timeline analysis

2. **Voting Pattern Analysis**
   - Party line voting analysis
   - Cross-party collaboration detection
   - Issue-based voting clusters
   - Voting history timelines

3. **Bill Analytics**
   - Success rate by sponsor type
   - Bill progress stage analysis
   - Topic categorization
   - Chamber-specific metrics

### Phase 2: LLM Integration (PLANNED)

1. **Parliamentary Intelligence API**
   - Natural language queries for parliamentary data
   - Member profile summaries
   - Voting record explanations
   - Bill impact analysis

2. **Data Refresh Automation**
   - Daily/weekly scrapers for new data
   - Monitor for new members, votes, bills
   - Incremental updates with change detection

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11 (with WSL2 available)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (REST API)
- **Database**: SQLite 3
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Package Manager**: pip with pyproject.toml
- **Testing**: pytest (25/25 tests passing)

---

## Blockers

**None** - All Phase 1 blockers resolved ✅

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics (as of 2025-10-22 - After Senate Support & Historical Collection)
- **Members**: 1,701 MPs (spanning 1993-2025)
  - 1,070 with official PersonIds (< 900000)
  - 631 with temporary IDs (>= 900000) - Parliament 35 & unmatched
- **Senators**: 99 current senators (CSG, ISG, PSG, C, GRO, Non-affiliated)
- **Roles**: 19,930 records (MP, Party, Committee, Office roles)
- **Votes**: 118,494 votes (historical coverage across all 1,701 members)
