## Completed

- [x] Database schema implementation (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] All data extraction scrapers (members, roles, votes, bills, bill progress)
- [x] Complete FastAPI REST API with all endpoints
- [x] Database fully populated (455 members, 11K+ roles, 105K+ votes, 1K+ bills)
- [x] Schema compatibility fixes - API models match database
- [x] Comprehensive API testing suite (25/25 tests passing)
- [x] Database schema documentation
- [x] Project roadmap to AI-powered intelligence
- [x] Modern dependency management (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Standardized .ai/ workflow setup (cross-session context management)
- [x] Data audit completed (docs/DATA_AUDIT_REPORT.md)
- [x] Historical members import (1,246 members from 1993-2025)
- [x] Historical roles parsed from Excel (3,588 role entries with dates)

## Active

**Current Task**: Historical Members Import COMPLETE, Ready for Analytics Phase

- [x] Historical members imported (1,246 members, IDs 900000-901657)
- [x] Historical roles parsed and imported (3,588 role entries)
- [x] Duplicate detection working (412 duplicates skipped)
- [x] Scripts cleaned up (deleted backfill and one-time fix scripts)
- [ ] Ready to proceed with Phase 1.3: Basic Analytics API

## Next

Following data completeness fixes:
1. Backfill historical votes (43rd Parliament: 2019-2021, ~50K votes)
2. Enhance bill metadata (titles, summaries, royal assent dates)
3. Implement automated data refresh (daily votes, weekly bills/roles)
4. Build basic analytics API (member activity, voting patterns, bill metrics)

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics (as of 2025-10-22 - Updated)
- Members: 1,701 records (455 current + 1,246 historical)
- Roles: 14,885 records (11,297 current + 3,588 historical)
- Votes: 105,367 records (2021-2025, 4 years)
- Bills: 1,094 records (5 parliaments, ~10 years)
- Bill Progress: 5,636 records (all stages captured)
- Parliamentary Associations: 0 records (included in roles table)

### Data Audit Findings (Updated 2025-10-22)
- ✅ Parliamentary associations: 3,447 records IN roles table (not separate table)
- ✅ Bill progress: 5,636 stages captured (all bill lifecycle stages)
- ✅ Historical parliamentarians: 1,246 unique members imported (35th-45th, 1993-2025)
  - IDs: 900000-901657 (clearly identifiable as historical/assumed IDs)
  - 3,588 historical roles with date ranges, constituencies, parties
  - 412 duplicates skipped (already in current 455 members)
- ✅ Data spans: 1993-2025 (32 years of parliamentary history)
