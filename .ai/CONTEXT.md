## Completed

- [x] Database schema implementation (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] All data extraction scrapers (members, roles, votes, bills, bill progress)
- [x] Complete FastAPI REST API with all endpoints
- [x] Database fully populated (455 members, 11K+ roles, 105K+ votes, 1K+ bills)
- [x] Schema compatibility fixes - API models match database
- [x] Comprehensive API testing suite (25/25 tests passing)
- [x] Database schema documentation
- [x] Project roadmap to AI-powered intelligence
- [x] Modern dependency management (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Standardized .ai/ workflow setup (cross-session context management)
- [x] Data audit completed (docs/DATA_AUDIT_REPORT.md)

## Active

**Current Task**: Bill Progress Enhancement Complete, Historical Members Next

- [x] Bill progress schema updated (added state, state_name columns)
- [x] Bill progress scraper modified (captures ALL stages, not just completed)
- [x] Bill scraper running (409/1094 bills done, ~15 min remaining)
- [ ] Decision needed: Import 1,658 historical parliamentarians (without member_ids)

---

## Next

Following data completeness fixes:
1. Backfill historical votes (43rd Parliament: 2019-2021, ~50K votes)
2. Enhance bill metadata (titles, summaries, royal assent dates)
3. Implement automated data refresh (daily votes, weekly bills/roles)
4. Build basic analytics API (member activity, voting patterns, bill metrics)

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11 (with WSL2 available)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (REST API)
- **Database**: SQLite 3
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Package Manager**: pip with pyproject.toml
- **Testing**: pytest (25/25 tests passing)

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics (as of 2025-10-22)
- Members: 455 records (current MPs)
- Roles: 11,297 records (multiple types)
- Votes: 105,367 records (2021-2025, 4 years)
- Bills: 1,094 records (5 parliaments, ~10 years)
- Bill Progress: 2,345 records (~2.1 stages/bill)
- Parliamentary Associations: 0 records (EMPTY - needs population)

### Data Audit Findings (Updated 2025-10-22)
- ✅ Parliamentary associations: 3,447 records IN roles table (not separate table)
- ✅ Bill progress: Capturing ALL stages now (not just completed)
  - 3,466+ stages captured (was 2,345 completed-only)
  - State 1 "Not reached": 2,486 stages
  - State 4 "Completed": 860 stages
- ✅ Historical parliamentarians found: 1,658 members (35th-45th, 1993-2025)
- ❌ Historical member_ids missing (Excel has names/dates/parties but no IDs)
