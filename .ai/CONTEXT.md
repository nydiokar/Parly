## Active

**Current Task**: Complete Data Pipeline Before Building Frontend

**What Changed** (2025-10-23):
- Pivoted from "AI-powered intelligence" to "Data Visualization Platform"
- Identified 5 components to build (funny findings, budget, bills, votes, petitions)
- Discovered bill summaries available in XML (game changer!)
- Discovered motion text available in Journal PDFs
- Cleaned up 12 exploration documents
- Created final roadmap and data sources documentation

**Immediate Tasks**:
- [x] **Build Bill XML Scraper** (get summaries for better analysis) - COMPLETED ✅
- [ ] **Run Bill XML Migration & Scraper** (needs API stopped, ~2 hours runtime)
- [ ] **Build Journal PDF Scraper** (get motion text for opposition votes)
- [ ] **Update database schema** (add vote_motions table for journal data)
- [ ] **THEN** build frontend visualizations

## Next

### Phase 0: Data Pipeline Completion (THIS WEEK)

**Missing Scrapers:**
1. **Bill XML Scraper** (HIGH PRIORITY - 4-6 hours)
   - Fetch bill summaries from XML
   - Better topic extraction than titles alone
   - Pattern: `/Bills/{parl}{sess}/{chamber}/C-{num}/C-{num}_1/C-{num}_E.xml`

2. **Journal PDF Scraper** (HIGH PRIORITY - 1-2 days)
   - Fetch motion text for opposition votes
   - Critical for vote stories component
   - Pattern: `/House/{parl}{sess}/Journals/{sitting:03d}/Journal{sitting:03d}.PDF`

3. **Petition Scraper** (LOW PRIORITY - later)
   - Fetch petition data
   - Pattern: `/petitions/en/Petition/Search?parl=X&output=xml`

### The 5 Components (12-week plan in FINAL_ROADMAP.md)

1. **General/Context** (Week 1-2) - Funny findings, 4-day week, party switchers
2. **Budget Analysis** (Week 5-6) - Where money goes, party voting on spending
3. **Bills Visualization** (Week 3-4) - What bills do, where they die
4. **Vote Stories** (Week 7-8) - Opposition motions analysis
5. **Petitions** (Week 11-12) - What people care about

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11 (with WSL2 available)
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (REST API)
- **Database**: SQLite 3
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Package Manager**: pip with pyproject.toml
- **Testing**: pytest (25/25 tests passing)

---

## Blockers

**None** - All Phase 1 blockers resolved ✅

## Notes

### Project Architecture
- Scrapers → Raw Data → SQLite Database → FastAPI → API Clients
- Production-ready scrapers with retry logic, checkpointing, duplicate prevention
- API running on http://localhost:8000 with interactive docs

### Key Decisions
- SQLite chosen for simplicity (can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed)
- Vote schema works well despite normalization opportunities (defer optimization)
- PROGRESS_LOG.md captures work artifacts, .ai/ provides session context
- Focus shifting to analytics and LLM integration phases

### Database Statistics (as of 2025-10-22 - After Senate Support & Historical Collection)
- **Members**: 1,701 MPs (spanning 1993-2025)
  - 1,070 with official PersonIds (< 900000)
  - 631 with temporary IDs (>= 900000) - Parliament 35 & unmatched
- **Senators**: 99 current senators (CSG, ISG, PSG, C, GRO, Non-affiliated)
- **Roles**: 19,930 records (MP, Party, Committee, Office roles)
- **Votes**: 118,494 votes (historical coverage across all 1,701 members)
  - Expanded from 105K → 118K (+13K votes from historical members)
  - Covers Parliaments 35-45 (1993-2025)
- **Bills**: 7,061 bills (House + Senate, comprehensive coverage)
  - House of Commons: 6,271 bills
  - Senate: 790 bills
  - Expanded from 1,094 → 7,061 (+546% increase!)
- **Bill Progress**: Tracked for all collected bills
