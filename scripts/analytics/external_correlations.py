External Correlations - Connect Parliament Data to Outside World

What if we correlate parliamentary activity with:
- Economic crises (2008 crash, COVID)
- Scandals (SNC-Lavalin, WE Charity, etc.)
- Olympic years (do they slack off?)
- Cannabis legalization timeline
- Major news events
- Prime Minister approval ratings
- Housing prices
- Gas prices
- Stock market crashes

Find the unexpected connections!
