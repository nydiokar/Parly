## üî• **THE SMOKING GUNS (PENDING VERIFICATION)**

### 1. **THE SUMMER VACATION SCANDAL** ‚òÄÔ∏è

**The Finding:**
- **July: 0 votes**
- **August: 0 votes**
- June: 27.8% of annual votes (cramming before vacation)

**Why It's Viral:**
- Everyone can relate to summer vacation
- MPs make $194,000/year
- "Must be nice to take 2 months off"
- Explains why nothing gets done

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Is this consistent across all years?
- ‚úÖ Do they genuinely do ZERO work or is it committee work not in our data?
- ‚úÖ Is July/August officially "recess" or are they supposed to work?
- ‚úÖ Check against official parliamentary calendar

**Visualization Ideas:**
- Calendar heatmap showing vote density by month
- "Your job vs. Their job" comparison
- Title: **"Parliament Takes 2 Months Off Every Summer (On Your Dime)"**

### 2. **THE 4-DAY WORK WEEK (FOR MPs ONLY)** üìÖ

**The Finding:**
- Monday-Thursday: 96% of all votes

- Sunday: 0.0%
- Wednesday is peak (31.4%)

**Why It's Viral:**
- Friday = basically a long weekend

- MPs have privileged schedule
- Relatable frustration

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Is Friday officially a sitting day?
- ‚úÖ Do they do constituency work on Fridays?

**Visualization Ideas:**
- Bar chart: Mon-Thu vs. Fri-Sun
- Weekly calendar with activity heatmap
- Title: **"MPs Work 4 Days. You Work 5. They Make $194,000."**

### 3. **OLYMPIC DISTRACTION** üèÖ

**The Finding:**
- **23% LESS work during Olympic years**
- Average work Olympic years: 206.5
- Average work other years: 266.6
- Pattern holds across multiple Olympics

**Why It's Viral:**
- Proves they're distracted
- Olympics = national pride vs. governance
- Quantifiable neglect
- Relatable: "I watch Olympics at work too, but I get fired"

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Are Olympic years also election years? (confounding variable)
- ‚úÖ Check if pattern is statistically significant

**The Finding:**
- **23% FEWER bills during economic crises**
- Average crisis years: 480 bills
- Average normal years: 625 bills
- Pattern: 2008 financial crisis, 2020 COVID

**Why It's Viral:**
- When you need them most, they do least
- Counter-intuitive (shouldn't crises = more action?)
- Recent (COVID) = very relatable
- Shows system failure

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Are crisis years also minority governments? (different dynamics)
- ‚úÖ Check if "fewer bills" but "more important bills"?

- 2019 SNC-Lavalin: 0 bills (total freeze)
- 2020 WE Charity: -36% (hiding)
- Pattern inconsistent: sometimes flood, sometimes freeze

**Why It's Viral:**
- Reveals political calculation
- "Are they distracting us?"
- Pattern recognition = conspiracy catnip
- Proves they're reactive, not proactive

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Check exact timing (scandal month vs. bill introduction)

- Martin 2003: -100% (data issue?)
- Harper 2006: -100% (data issue?)
- Trudeau 2015: -100% (data issue?)

**Why It's Viral:**
- "First 100 days" rhetoric is lies
- They take a year to figure things out
- Campaigned on change, delivered nothing
- Election promises = empty

**VERIFY:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS LOOKS LIKE A DATA ISSUE!
- ‚úÖ Check parliament start dates vs. PM appointment dates
- ‚úÖ Many 0 bills = likely data mapping error (year estimation is rough)
- ‚úÖ Need actual dates, not estimated years
- ‚úÖ **PROBABLY WRONG - FIX THE YEAR CALCULATION FIRST**

**Status:** üö® **LIKELY DATA ERROR - DON'T USE UNTIL FIXED** üö®

### 7. **ELECTION YEAR PANIC (FROM EARLIER)**

**The Finding:**
- **84% MORE bills in election years**
- Election years: 1,024 bills average
- Regular years: 557 bills average

**Why It's Viral:**
- (Already covered in WILD_DISCOVERIES.md)
- Most reliable finding so far
- Clear pattern, makes sense

**VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ This one looks solid
- ‚úÖ Recheck with exact dates
- ‚úÖ Control for parliament session length

---

## üìä **DATA QUALITY ISSUES TO FIX**

### **Critical Issues:**

1. **Year Estimation is Rough**
   - Current method: `year = 1993 + (parliament_number - 35) * 3`
   - Problem: Parliaments don't last exactly 3 years
   - Fix: Use actual `from_date` and `to_date` from roles/bills
   - Impact: Affects PM honeymoon, crisis timing, scandal timing

2. **Missing Vote Dates**
   - Some votes have no `vote_date`
   - Can't analyze day-of-week or month patterns accurately
   - Fix: Check data source, might need to scrape dates

3. **Bill Progress "Stages" Confusion**
   - Heartbreak bills showing 16 stages but dying at "First Reading"?
   - Might be counting all progress events, not distinct stages
   - Fix: Clarify what "stage" means

4. **December 7, 2023 Anomaly**
   - 11,356 votes in one day is suspicious
   - Likely bundled votes or data error
   - Fix: Investigate that specific date

### **Validation Checklist for Tomorrow:**

- [ ] Fix year calculation (use actual dates, not estimates)
- [ ] Verify summer break pattern across multiple years
- [ ] Check official parliamentary calendar for sitting days
- [ ] Investigate December 7, 2023 vote count
- [ ] Validate Olympic year correlation with proper controls
- [ ] Cross-reference scandal dates with bill introduction dates
- [ ] Check if Friday is officially a sitting day
- [ ] Verify crisis year bill counts manually for 2-3 examples

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL FIXES NEEDED**

### **Priority 1: Fix Year Calculation**

Replace this:
```python
year = 1993 + (bill.parliament_number - 35) * 3
```

With actual date-based calculation:
```python
# Use role dates or bill introduction dates
# Map parliament numbers to actual year ranges
PARLIAMENT_YEARS = {
    35: (1994, 1997),
    36: (1997, 2000),
    # ... etc
}
```

### **Priority 2: Validate Vote Dates**

```python
# Check for missing dates
votes_with_dates = session.query(Vote).filter(Vote.vote_date.isnot(None)).count()
total_votes = session.query(Vote).count()
print(f"Votes with dates: {votes_with_dates}/{total_votes}")
```

### **Priority 3: Cross-Reference External Events**

Create proper timeline mappings with EXACT dates:
```python
SCANDALS = {
    datetime(2019, 2, 7): "SNC-Lavalin story breaks",
    datetime(2019, 3, 29): "Jody Wilson-Raybould testifies",
    # ... exact dates
}
```
