# Parly Project - Final Actionable Roadmap

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Role**: Data Analyst (not journalist)
**Goal**: Data visualization with stories as subproduct

---

## üéØ **THE 5 COMPONENTS**

### **Priority Order:**
1. **General/Context** (Funny findings, easy to digest) - HIGHEST
2. **Budget Analysis** (if we can find systematic way) - HIGH
3. **Bills Visualization** - MEDIUM
4. **Vote Stories** (Opposition motions) - MEDIUM
5. **Petitions** - LOWEST

---

## üìä **COMPONENT 1: GENERAL/CONTEXT (Funny & Interesting)**

### **What to Build:**

#### **A. Parliament Seating Visualization**
**Visualization**: Interactive seating chart colored by party
- Current parliament (45th)
- Dynamic (can switch between parliaments)
- Click seat ‚Üí see MP details

**Data Needed**: ‚úÖ We have (members + parties)
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Tech**: D3.js or simple SVG

---

#### **B. Election Year Panic**
**Finding**: More bills introduced in election years
**Visualization**: Bar chart comparing election vs non-election years

**Data Needed**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to fix year calculations (parliament to actual years)
- ‚úÖ Have bill counts

**Effort**: 1 day (after fixing year mapping)

---

#### **C. 4-Day Work Week Pattern**
**Finding**: 96% of votes happen Mon-Thu
**Visualization**: Simple bar chart by day of week

**Data Needed**: ‚úÖ We have (verified)
**Effort**: 0.5 days
**Status**: READY TO BUILD

---

#### **D. Activity Heatmaps**
**Two versions:**
1. **Votes per month** (exclude budget votes for clarity)
2. **Bills introduced per month**

**Visualization**: Calendar heatmap (year √ó month)

**Data Needed**:
- ‚úÖ Have dates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to classify vote types (budget vs non-budget)

**Effort**: 1-2 days

---

#### **E. Party Switchers (Anne C. Cools)**
**Finding**: Who changed parties most over career
**Visualization**: Timeline showing party changes

**Data Needed**: ‚úÖ We have (roles table with party + dates)
**Effort**: 1 day
**Status**: Query needs refinement

---

#### **F. Unlikely Friendships**
**Finding**: Cross-party voting patterns
**Visualization**: Network graph (MPs as nodes, voting similarity as edges)

**Data Needed**: ‚úÖ We have
**Effort**: 2-3 days (compute similarity matrix)
**Complexity**: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

#### **G. Topic Shift Over Time**
**Finding**: Which topics get attention over years
**Visualization**: Stacked area chart or heatmap

**Data Needed**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need topic extraction from bill titles
- ‚úÖ Have bills with dates

**Effort**: 2-3 days (topic clustering)

---

## üí∞ **COMPONENT 2: BUDGET ANALYSIS**

### **What to Build:**

#### **Budget Day Detector**
**Goal**: Automatically find budget voting days

**Algorithm**:
```python
def is_budget_day(date, vote_topics):
    # A day with 100+ votes on estimates/concurrence
    budget_keywords = ['estimate', 'concurrence', 'opposed', 'supplementary']
    budget_count = count_votes_with_keywords(vote_topics, budget_keywords)

    return budget_count > 100
```

**Output**: List of budget days: Dec 7 2023, June 17 2025, April 11 2024, etc.

---

#### **Budget Breakdown Extractor**
**Goal**: For each budget day, extract spending details

**Data Sources**:
1. **Votes table**: Who voted how
2. **Journal PDF**: Motion text with dollar amounts

**Process**:
1. Identify budget days automatically
2. Download corresponding Journal PDFs
3. Parse motion text + amounts
4. Structure as JSON

**Effort**: 3-4 days (PDF parsing is tricky)

---

#### **Budget Visualization**
**Shows**:
- Total approved per budget day
- Top 10 biggest allocations
- Funny items ($1 votes)
- Party voting patterns (who opposed what spending)
- Institutional spending breakdown

**Effort**: 2-3 days (after data extracted)

---

## üìú **COMPONENT 3: BILLS VISUALIZATION**

### **What to Build:**

#### **Bill Title Analyzer**
**Goal**: Categorize bills by type and topic

**Categories (from long titles)**:
- "Act to amend..." ‚Üí Law improvements
- "Act for granting to His Majesty..." ‚Üí Budget bills
- "Act to establish..." ‚Üí New frameworks
- "Act respecting..." ‚Üí New topics/issues

**Extraction**:
```python
patterns = {
    'amend': r'Act to amend the (.+?) \(',
    'grant': r'granting to His Majesty',
    'establish': r'Act to establish (.+?)$',
    'respecting': r'Act respecting (.+?)$'
}
```

**Topics** (from brackets/short titles):
- Healthcare, Environment, Justice, Immigration, etc.

---

#### **Bill Progress Tracker**
**Goal**: Where do bills die?

**Visualization**: Sankey diagram
- Introduced ‚Üí 1st Reading ‚Üí 2nd Reading ‚Üí Committee ‚Üí 3rd Reading ‚Üí Royal Assent
- Show dropout at each stage
- Color by topic

**Data Needed**: ‚úÖ We have (bill_progress table)
**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

#### **Combined View**
**Dashboard showing**:
- Bill categories distribution (pie chart)
- Topics over time (line chart)
- Success rate by category (bar chart)
- Where bills die (Sankey)

**Effort**: 3-4 days total

---

## üó≥Ô∏è **COMPONENT 4: VOTE STORIES (Opposition Motions)**

### **What to Build:**

#### **A. Opposition Motion Identifier**
**Goal**: Filter votes to Opposition motions only

```python
def is_opposition_motion(vote_topic):
    return 'opposition motion' in vote_topic.lower()
```

**Data Enhancement Needed**:
- ‚ùå Currently missing: Who proposed it
- ‚ùå Currently missing: Full motion text

**Solution**: Extract from Journal PDFs

---

#### **B. Journal Scraper**
**Goal**: Download and parse Journal PDFs

**URL Pattern**:
```
https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/House/{parl}{sess}/Journals/{sitting:03d}/Journal{sitting:03d}.PDF

Example:
Parliament 45, Session 1, Sitting 26:
https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/House/451/Journals/026/Journal026.PDF
```

**Extract From PDF**:
1. Motion text (what they voted on)
2. Proposer (which MP/party)
3. Vote number (to link to our database)

**Effort**: 3-4 days (PDF parsing + matching to our votes)

---

#### **C. Opposition Motion Dashboard**
**Shows**:
- List of all Opposition motions (last 2-3 years)
- Filter by: Party, Topic, Result
- Click one ‚Üí full story:
  - Motion text
  - Who proposed
  - How each party voted

2. ‚úÖ Add vote type classifier (budget vs policy)
3. ‚úÖ Update url_templates.py

### **Day 2-3: First Visualization**
Build **4-Day Work Week** visualization:

---

## üö´ **IMPORTANT: SCOPE MANAGEMENT**

### **Exclude from Initial Builds**:
- ‚ùå Bill-related votes (keep only Opposition motions for vote stories)
- ‚ùå Hansard speeches (too complex, defer to later)
- ‚ùå Media context (manual research, not scalable)
- ‚ùå Historical votes before 2020 (focus on recent)

### **Keep Simple**:
- ‚úÖ Use structured data we have
- ‚úÖ Add context only where easy to extract
- ‚úÖ Manual work is OK for budget (5-10 days worth)
- ‚úÖ Focus on visualization quality over quantity

---

## üìä **TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### **Frontend**:
- Next.js 14
- Recharts + D3.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel deployment

### **Backend**:
- FastAPI (existing)
- New routes:
  - `/api/context/...` (funny findings)
  - `/api/bills/...` (bill analysis)
  - `/api/budget/...` (budget breakdown)
  - `/api/opposition/...` (opposition motions)
  - `/api/petitions/...` (petitions)

### **Data Processing**:
- Python scripts in `scripts/analysis/`
- PDF parsing: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
- Store extracted context in JSON files initially
- Later: migrate to database if needed

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Phase 1 Success**:
- ‚úÖ 4 visualizations live
- ‚úÖ Clean, professional design
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive
- ‚úÖ Share-worthy content

### **Overall Success**:
- Data-driven insights (not opinion)
- High-quality visualizations
- Interesting patterns revealed
- Scalable infrastructure for expansion

## üí¨ **THE PITCH (After Phase 1)**

> "I analyzed 32 years of Canadian parliamentary data."
>
> "118,000 votes. 7,000 bills. 1,700 MPs."
>
> "Found patterns nobody talks about:"
> - Parliament works 4 days a week
> - Bills die at predictable stages
> - Opposition proposes, government blocks
> - Money flows follow party lines
>
> "All visualized. All data-driven. No opinions, just facts."
