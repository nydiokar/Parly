### The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
1. Calculate voting similarity between all MPs per year
2. Generate network graph for each year (1993-2025)
3. Animate the evolution
4. Add "play/pause" controls
5. Highlight key moments (elections, major bills)

## üí° **Next Steps**

Want to build **"The Polarization Timeline"**?

I can help you:
1. Write the analytics queries (voting similarity calculations)
2. Design the FastAPI endpoints
3. Create the D3.js visualization code
4. Plan the deployment strategy

**This could go viral. Let's build it.** üöÄ
