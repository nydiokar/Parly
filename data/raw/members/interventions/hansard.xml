I suspect that the Liberals have set themselves to tune out any words I say and perhaps instead are watching cat videos on their phones.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646712">The documents in question are really not the issue here, and the government knows that. The government does not want its own Liberal members to understand what the issues are. It wants them to keep watching cat videos in the hopes that they will not realize just how much contempt their <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">leader</Affiliation> and their ministers have for them and for the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646713">The <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> has ruled that the Liberals have violated an order by the House to turn over evidence to the police for a criminal investigation into the latest Liberal scandal, which involves $400 million. In essence, the government is telling us that it knows best and that the will of the House can be ignored no matter what the Speaker and the members say.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646714">However, as the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in his mandate letter to the previous government House leader, “Canadians expect us to work hard, speak truthfully and be committed to advancing their interests and aspirations. When we make mistakes—as we all will—Canadians expect us to acknowledge them, and most importantly, to learn from them.”</ParaText><ParaText id="8646715">It is time for the government to speak truthfully. It does not want the documents released, not because it is concerned about the legal process but because it is embarrassed. The Auditor General has found that Liberal appointees gave $400 million of taxpayers' money to their own companies. This involved 186 conflicts of interest. The government is concerned that providing the documents would reveal even more corruption.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646716">The issue is about $400 million of wasted or stolen taxpayers' money, while Canadians cannot afford to eat, heat their home and house themselves. The government's embarrassment is understandable. The implication of what has so far been revealed is that Liberals were illegally benefiting Liberals, advancing their own interests and aspirations instead of the country's best interests. What was supposed to be a way of fighting climate change was instead a way to line the pockets of people who had Liberal connections.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646717">After nine years of the current government, Canadians are not surprised by the climate hypocrisy; however, there is no reason for them to accept it. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has apparently forgotten his own words about admitting mistakes and learning from them, or maybe he thinks he and his government are so perfect that mistakes are impossible so there is nothing to acknowledge and nothing to learn.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646718">The government seems to think there is a problem with the opposition parties in this matter. The Liberals say that the work of the House is being tied up and that if the opposition would just allow a committee to deal with the matter, then we could get on with more important business. The government wants to know why the opposition cannot see that.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646719">When Liberal cabinet ministers make statements like that, they seem to have checked their collective brain at the door. What is more important for the House than to establish that the government does not dictate to the elected members? When the House makes an order and the Speaker affirms the order, the government does not get to say no.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646720">I realize it would be more convenient for the Liberals if the opposition did not exist. That may be why its first idea at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was to suggest that it be given free rein to act without parliamentary oversight. The government wanted the opposition parties to go home and allow it to work without oversight. That is not the way parliamentary democracy is supposed to work. I would hope that the government MPs who were here at the time look back on that period with a certain amount of embarrassment that they were persuaded to agree to such a thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646721"> This was, after all, supposed to be the most open and transparent government in Canadian history. In 2013, the newly elected Liberal leader, today's <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, said, “Political leadership is about raising the bar on openness and transparency.” Eleven years later, the government has a reputation for secrecy. The Prime Minister will not release the documents. What is he trying to hide?</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8646722">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> seems to have forgotten his own words, or maybe he was just saying something he did not believe in order to get elected. Canadians believed him when he said, “For me, transparency isn’t a slogan or a tactic; it’s a way of doing business.” In 2024, Canadians doubt the truth of that statement. Obviously it was a slogan and a tactic designed to fool the public.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646723">Canadians are no longer fooled. If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government believed in transparency, there would be no need for me to be speaking today. They would have released the documents already. Instead they look like a criminal with something to hide.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646724">The supposedly open and transparent government is defying the will of the House. The Liberals' actions show just how hollow their idealistic words are. If the Liberals want to move the work of the House forward, something we all would like to see, then the path forward is simple: Obey the will of the House, accept the ruling of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation> and provide the documents.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646725">What happens to the documents is not the Liberals' concern. They are not the Law Clerk. They are not the RCMP. The government should not be telling others what to do with the material. The Liberals have already shown that a cover-up is their preference. They must end the cover-up and hand over the evidence to the police so Parliament can get back to working for Canadians. Why do they continue to defy the will of the House and the ruling of their own <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>?</ParaText><ParaText id="8646726">It is probably worth mentioning again why this is an issue. The Auditor General of Canada found that the government, led by a <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who boasted about transparency, turned Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, into a slush fund for Liberal insiders. A recording of senior civil servants slammed the outright incompetence of the Liberal government, which gave 390 million dollars' worth of contracts inappropriately.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646727">The Auditor General also found that, first, SDTC gave $58 million to 10 ineligible projects that on some occasions could not demonstrate an environmental benefit or development of green technology. Second, $334 million was given to over 186 projects in which board members had a conflict of interest. Third, $58 million was given to projects without ensuring that contribution agreement terms were met. The Auditor General made it clear that the blame for the scandal falls on the industry minister, who did not sufficiently monitor the contracts that were given to Liberal insiders.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646728"> By not complying with the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>'s ruling, the Liberals have paralyzed Parliament, making it impossible for anyone here to address issues like the doubling of housing costs, Liberal food inflation, and crime and chaos. Given the Liberal record, I wonder whether that is their plan. With the level of incompetence they have displayed over the past nine years, I would not want to talk about housing, crime or the economy either, but maybe we should.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646729">After all, after nine years of the Liberal government, Canadians have never been less safe. Insane catch-and-release policies are putting dangerous repeat violent offenders back onto our streets. The reckless experiment of taxpayer-funded hard drugs has created crime, chaos and disorder across Canada. Statistics Canada has revealed that since 2015, violent crime is up by nearly 50%. Homicides are up 28%, while sexual assaults, auto theft and extortion are up 74%, 45% and 357% respectively.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8646730"> Meanwhile, the Liberals' failed experiment funding hard drugs with taxpayer dollars has increased drug deaths by 184% since 2015. In London, Ontario, the chief of police has been clear about the unfolding disaster, saying, “Diverted safe supply is being resold into our community. It's being trafficked into other communities and it is being used as currency in exchange for fentanyl, fuelling the drug trade.”</ParaText><ParaText id="8646731">In British Columbia, the Vancouver Police Department noted that around 50% of all hydromorphone seizures were diverted from the<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s taxpayer-funded hard drugs program. Since 2015, nearly 45,000 Canadians have died from drug overdose. It seems that everyone except the current government can see the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646732">When it comes to housing, the Liberals know they created a problem, but they do not know how to fix it. Housing has become unaffordable in Canada because we are failing to build enough homes for Canadians. This was confirmed by a recent report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, CMHC, which showed that Canada is still building fewer homes than in the 1970s, when Canada had half the population it has today.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646733">National housing starts declined by 13% between August 2023 and August 2024. There has been a 25% drop in housing starts in Ontario. In Toronto, housing starts in August 2024 had a massive 48% decline over 2023, while Vancouver saw a drop of 34% year over year.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646734">The Liberals' housing hell is not limited to Toronto or Vancouver. Across British Columbia, housing starts dropped by 31%, and in Victoria housing starts decline by 33%. Manitoba and Saskatchewan housing starts have dropped by 14% and 12% respectively during the first eight months of this year compared to the same period in 2023. Winnipeg's housing starts are down by 16% over the same period, while Ottawa had 17% fewer new housing projects. Housing remains unaffordable in Canada, in spite of the Liberals' giving billions of dollars to the same gatekeepers who caused the housing crisis in the first place.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646735">Since last year, food prices in Canada have risen overall by 3.9%, with meat up by 9.5% and margarine up by 9.9%. The price of baby food has increased by 5%. These price increases hit seniors and low-income Canadian families the hardest. According to a recent poll by Angus Reid Institute, more than one-third of Canadians have struggled to afford enough food to feed their family. This is unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646736"> Our food prices are an afterthought for the Liberal government. While inflation may have slowed, food prices are not going down, and the Liberal's carbon tax further restricts producers' competitiveness through added transportation costs. It is fair to say that Canada's food security is at a tipping point.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646737">These are definitely not topics that the Liberals want to address. Since they have no plans to fix anything, they instead tie up the work of the House, hoping that Canadians will not notice. The Liberals try to pretend that they are standing on principle, instead of being open and transparent. They are trying to convince Canadians that covering up wrongdoing is a virtue. Canadians do not believe them.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646738">The Liberals say it is all the opposition's fault, while they continue to do the wrong thing as they ignore the will of the House of Commons and the authority of the <Affiliation DbId="300999" Type="15">Speaker</Affiliation>. Instead they are trying to deflect the issue and are pretending the order is somehow improper. What could be more proper than the House of Commons' demanding accountability from the government? There is 800 years of constitutional tradition backing that up. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> may not like it, but we are not here to do what he likes; we are here to do what is right.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8646739">The government's House leader has said this debate is, “something every single Canadian should be extremely alarmed about.” I agree. Canadians should be alarmed and concerned about a government that thinks it is above the law. Canadians should be alarmed by a government whose ministers do not seem to understand what constitutes a conflict of interest. Canadians should be alarmed by a government that illegally rewards its friends. Canadians should be alarmed by a government that tries to cover things up while claiming to be open and transparent.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646740">Parliament needs to be respected by the government. The documents must be released. It is not the government's responsibility to consider what happens when the documents are released. It can let the law clerk and the RCMP worry about that. That is not the Liberals' job. The Liberals' duty is to release the documents and to stop their contempt of Parliament, which is the democratic system that they claim to uphold.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646741">When a party that claims to be the most transparent government in Canadian history refuses to respect the will of the House of Commons, Canadians are right in wondering what the party is trying to hide. We know there is something questionable about the $400 million. How much more is there? Canadians deserve to know the truth, no matter how much the Liberals want to cover it up.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646742">We all know why we are here. The Liberals' selective amnesia is not fooling Canadians. The Auditor General found evidence of serious mismanagement at SDTC, and maybe even criminal activity. The Liberals response to this, as with so many other things, is to cover it up and pretend there is no problem. Maybe, from their perspective, there is no problem. After all, apparently the funds in question went to those with Liberal connections. How can anyone see a conflict of interest in awarding contracts to a few friends?</ParaText><ParaText id="8646743">The Liberals need to remember that this is not their money. The $400 million did not come from the Liberal Party. It came from ordinary Canadians who are struggling to put food on the table as they are being carbon taxed to death. They deserve better. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is fond of telling the media and the House that Canadians will forgive him for not taking direction from the Conservatives. His ministers frequently use the same line. It makes for a nice media clip.</ParaText><ParaText id="8646744">However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers really should take direction from Conservatives respecting Parliament, ethics and transparency, not to mention crime, housing, taxation and balancing the budget. No, I do not think Canadians are going to forgive him.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="38675" IsProceduralTerm="1">Contempt of Parliament</Term><Term Id="94379" IsProceduralTerm="0">Green economy</Term><Term Id="54943" IsProceduralTerm="1">Motion to refer the matter to the appropriate committee</Term><Term Id="40501" IsProceduralTerm="1">Motions for the production of papers</Term><Term Id="40506" IsProceduralTerm="1">Parliamentary privilege</Term><Term Id="54944" IsProceduralTerm="1">Prima facie breach of privilege</Term><Term Id="95818" IsProceduralTerm="0">Rights of Parliament</Term><Term Id="212791" IsProceduralTerm="0">Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs</Term><Term Id="10888" IsProceduralTerm="0">Sustainable Development Technology Canada</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="13365326" Hour="12" Minute="11"><Person><FirstName>Mike</FirstName><LastName>Lake</LastName><Honorific>Hon.</Honorific><Constituency>Edmonton—Wetaskiwin</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="13366214" Hour="12" Minute="31"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="13365709" EventId="12951297" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12951297/?ml=en" Sequence="34" Page="27001" PdfPage="15" TypeId="38" Date="2024-10-28" Hour="12" Minute="33" Second="07" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=13365709" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Oct%2028%202024%2012:33PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=13365709"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Orders of the Day</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Privilege [Reference to Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs]</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12951297"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8646748">Mr. Speaker, the ask is mutual.

Canada is very much a nation of immigrants, and I am proud to be one of them. I came to this country as a young man, leaving behind a civil war that had been raging for much of my life. I came here seeking peace, stability and opportunity. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549792">I will admit I did not know that much about Canada before moving here. It did not seem necessary to learn more about what I already knew, that Canada is a cold country with warm people, a place where newcomers are readily accepted regardless of nation of origin, race, colour or creed. What more did I need to know? </ParaText><ParaText id="8549793">I was welcomed here with open arms. It did not take long for me to realize that Canada was a place I would be proud to call home. I found a job, got married, started a family and realized just how much this country means to me. I knew I wanted to be part of it and that my future and my family's future was here. I became a Canadian citizen in 1994. I started a business, got involved in community organizations and, eventually, was asked by the people of Edmonton Manning if I would represent them in this House. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my country in this way. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549794">One of the delights of being a member of Parliament is that I have been able to hear so many stories from my fellow Canadians, especially those, like myself, who came to this country to make it home. I have heard hundreds of times how people came to this country and why they chose Canada. Pledging allegiance to this nation is a serious business. In becoming a Canadian, you are saying that you want to be part of the greatest family in the world. Like marriage, becoming a citizen is a serious commitment. It is not something that should be entered into lightly for convenience sake. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549795">As Canadians, we are all very aware of our rights. We even have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What we do not talk often about is our responsibilities as citizens. It is not only about what Canada can do for us, it is also about what we will do for Canada. Being a Canadian should mean something more than having a passport accepted everywhere in the world. Being a Canadian is a state of mind, of a joining together of different people for a common cause. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549796">Because I know what it means to be a Canadian, I cannot support Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>, an act to amend the Citizenship Act, 2024. To me, this legislation devalues the idea of citizenship. It is as if the Liberals want to grant citizenship to tourists. I can see the advertising slogan now, “Come spend your summers in Canada, and after 10 years we will throw in citizenship as an added bonus.” Why are those who wish to become Canadian citizens no longer expected to live here and become part of our country and society? Where is the commitment on their part to become part of the community? Does being Canadian not matter anymore? </ParaText><ParaText id="8549797">In 2006, the Canadian government spent $94 million evacuating 15,000 Canadians from a conflict in Lebanon, my home country. Many of those were people who had the benefit of Canadian citizenship with minimal connection to Canada. Once things died down, they went right back to the country that they thought of as their first home. They were “Canadians of convenience”. That is why the Harper government amended the Citizenship Act to restrict the transmission of Canadian citizenship to only one generation born outside of Canada. It does not seem right to me or to most Canadians that citizenship should be granted to generations of people with no ties to Canada.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8549798">Perhaps it is time to tighten our citizenship rules, not weaken them. We do not need more Canadians of convenience, people who hold Canadian citizenship but live abroad and do not participate in Canadian society. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549799">The legislation is intended to address concerns raised by the Ontario Superior Court, which ruled that the first-generation cut-off rule in the Citizenship Act was unconstitutional. However, Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document> is a hastily written, ill-conceived proposal that needs a lot of work to make it acceptable to Canadians. Instead of fixing the problem, the bill would weaken the rules. Under this act, the bill introduces a substantial connection test; for parents to pass on citizenship to children born abroad, the parents must demonstrate that they were physically present in Canada for 1,095 cumulative days at any point in their lives. This rule applies to those who are Canadian-born, those who are naturalized Canadians and those who were born abroad. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549800">I do not know what members think of as “substantial”, but being present in Canada for a thousand or so cumulative days does not seem to me to be much of a connection. If people live elsewhere but spend summer vacations in Canada, it would not take that long to reach the required number of days. I can see that this could be a part of a new tourist industry. Maybe I am biased, but I think that experiencing a couple of Edmonton winters should be a requirement for anyone wishing to become a Canadian citizen. After all, one of the things that bind us together as Canadians is the shared experience of cold weather. Certainly, without amendment, the bill would increase the stress on the civil service. Somehow, someone will be tasked with checking that the citizenship applicant has really spent 1,095 cumulative days in Canada. What burden of proof would be required? </ParaText><ParaText id="8549801">When I became a Canadian, I did so knowing that I would give my all to this country. I understood that Canadian citizenship was a privilege, not a right, and that it was something offered to those who understood what it meant to be Canadian, who accepted Canadian values and who wanted to work together with other Canadians to make our society even greater. Canada is not my backup plan; it is my only plan. I know how important Canadian citizenship is. However, I do not see that importance reflected in Bill <Document DbId="13103731" Type="3">C-71</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="8549802">Both the Liberal Party and the NDP want to play a game. All of a sudden, after they made such a mess of the immigration rules and laws in Canada, they are starting another chapter to make a bigger mess, adding more stress to a failing department and a failing immigration system.

What a reward for propping up the Liberals. </ParaText><ParaText id="8507623">This bill, rather than encouraging electoral participation, would delay the day when Canadian voters can hold parliamentarians to account in a federal election.

The Liberals want to move it a week later, to October 27. It is merely a coincidence that 80 members of Parliament would qualify for a pension on October 26, 2025, a pension they would not qualify for if they were to be defeated on October 20 or if they choose not to offer themselves to the voters once more.</ParaText><ParaText id="8507625">Of course, just about every day is a holiday or a special occasion for someone. October 20, 2025, is Guatemala's revolution day. It is also Heroes' Day in Kenya, Jamaica and the British Virgin Islands. For Jews, it is Sukkoth. Let us not forget the date is also International Chefs Day and World Osteoporosis Day. Serbia will be celebrating Belgrade Liberation Day on that day. In Vietnam, it is Women's Day. In Ukraine, it is breast cancer awareness day. Those are all dates worthy of celebrating, even if the Liberals do not mention them as important enough to mention as a reason for changing the fixed election date. </ParaText><ParaText id="8507626">There is no perfect date for an election, no date that does not conflict with something else for some people.

However, neither the Liberals nor the NDP have shown any understanding of the value of a dollar.

Conservatives do not believe in changing the rules to benefit themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="8507633"> I would like to list the names of those who are set to benefit from the legislation.

The rules and conventions of this place, as it is sometimes the case, allow members to pretend that the truth does not matter.

Sadly, that has not happened with Bill <Document DbId="12924814" Type="3">C-64</Document>, the pharmacare act, which is probably because the legislation is so flawed that nothing can fix it. The only proper fix is to bury it.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434010">I wish that tonight we were debating the merits of a proposed national pharmacare program. Many Canadians would like to see such a thing, although they might not be so enthusiastic once they saw the price tag. The only resemblance the bill before us has to pharmacare is in the name. If we had asked Canadians what they expected to receive from the NDP-Liberal coalition besides ever-increasing taxes, high inflation, sky-high crime rates and housing shortages, they would probably have said, “Well, at least they have promised pharmacare.” </ParaText><ParaText id="8434011">If we had asked what that meant, they would have said, “free prescription drugs for everyone: drugs to treat heart disease or cancer, life-saving drugs and maybe penicillin to treat any number of less serious illnesses”. Instead, what the government is offering is a pledge to consider funding contraceptives and diabetes drugs. It is not a pharmacare plan; it is an empty promise. It is not what anyone was expecting, but it is no surprise. It is not as if the Liberals really want a national pharmacare program. If they did, they would not have needed the NDP to push them into creating the bill before us.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434012">The Liberals' plan is empty and it is pretty simple. They want to delay as much as possible to convince the NDP that a plan is coming and that therefore the incompetent government must be propped up. I have to give the Liberals credit for their political skill in this matter. They have the NDP so completely fooled that the government faces no chance of defeat no matter the scandals and no matter how much Liberal polices are hurting Canadians. The NDP is blindly accepting a Liberal promise, apparently unwilling to admit that they have been fooled.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434013">I think it is safe to predict that when Canadians go to the polls, whether it is in October 2025 or earlier, the NDP will not be able to point to a functioning pharmacare program, not even the limited one that the bill calls for. However, the promise will have accomplished its purpose: keeping an undeserving government in power. It is the Canadian electorate that will hold both the NDP and the Liberals accountable for their actions. It is the Canadian people who will elect a Conservative government that actually cares about serving them and does not just care about political power.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434014">The bill is being shoved through in haste by a government that is so desperate for approval. The <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> is assuring Canadians that the pharmacare plan should not jeopardize the drug coverage that millions of Canadians have through private insurers. I am sure he is well-intentioned when he makes that statement; he may even believe his words, but good intentions are not reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434015">The CEO of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association says that the bill could indeed cause disruption for those who have existing drug plans. Either he is right or the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is right; it cannot be both. Given the Liberal track record, I suspect the minister is indulging in some wishful thinking, which is not surprising from a government that thinks budgets magically balance themselves, something that has not happened under the current <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434016"> By using time allocation, the government is rushing the bill through the House without opportunity for proper scrutiny, which is no surprise. Despite having had two years to figure out how they were going to implement their deal with the NDP, the Liberals put together the legislation at the last minute.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8434017">It is window dressing, designed not to define pharmacare, but to keep the government in office for a few more months to deny Canadians what they want most, which is an end to Liberal overspending and incompetence.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434018">The proposed bill is a promise, and Canadians know what happens when Liberals make promises. They have made promises in the past nine years. The reality is that, when the Liberals make a promise, things always seem to get worse. They promised affordable housing, and housing costs have doubled under their watch. They promised that the carbon tax would not cost us anything, and we find now that 60% of families are paying more than they collect. The Liberals promised that taxes would go down, and taxes have gone up. They promised safe streets, and then delivered crime, chaos, drugs and disorder. It is no wonder Canadians are afraid things will get worse when the Liberals promise pharmacare.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434019">If the government were serious about helping Canadians, it would have gone about things differently. It would have consulted with the insurance industry, found out what the private insurance sector was offering and what the non-profit sector was providing, examined existing provincial coverage, and discovered if there were gaps that needed to be addressed. Instead, the Liberals decided to rush blindly ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434020"> Canadians know the government is not worth the cost. That has been proven time and time again over the past nine years. Is this pharmacare program worth the cost? An honest answer is that nobody knows because the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> cannot tell us how much it will cost. Any numbers he tosses around are more wishful thinking than reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434021">Canadians are struggling and looking to the federal government for help. Inflation eats away at their paycheques. Every trip to the grocery store, it seems the prices are going up. Liberals' catch-and-release bail policies are turning violent offenders loose to commit yet more crimes. Despite an ever-increasing carbon tax, the government has no plan to balance its books.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434022">The Liberals apparently have no desire to fix the problems created by their wasteful spending. They believe that water runs downhill but never reaches the bottom. They know they will not be in government when the bill for this mismanagement comes due. Food Banks Canada's 2024 poverty report card shows that almost 50% of Canadians feel financially worse off compared to last year, while 25% of Canadians are experiencing food insecurity.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434023">The cost of living has become so high that food banks have seen a 50% increase in visits since 2021. As a direct consequence of the government's inflationary spending and taxes, millions of Canadians are struggling to keep their heads above water, yet the Liberals ask us to take on faith that they know how to set up and run a pharmacare program without turning it into a disaster.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434024">This is the government that spent more than $50 million on an app that was supposed to cost $80,000, and it cannot tell us how or when that cost overrun happened, or who is responsible. Why should Canadians trust it to run anything?</ParaText><ParaText id="8434025">The good news is that this is not a serious piece of legislation. As I said, the Liberals have no idea what they are doing and no real intention to institute a pharmacare program. Bill <Document DbId="12924814" Type="3">C-64</Document> is a public relations exercise with which they hope to fool the NDP and Canadians into thinking they are doing something to help people. Given the Liberals track record, I doubt many Canadians will be fooled.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="236699" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare</Term><Term Id="38425" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="62794" IsProceduralTerm="0">Cost of living</Term><Term Id="39367" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government accountability</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39400" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government performance</Term><Term Id="39977" IsProceduralTerm="0">Health care system</Term><Term Id="54353" IsProceduralTerm="0">Health services accessibility</Term><Term Id="39593" IsProceduralTerm="0">Housing</Term><Term Id="39690" IsProceduralTerm="0">Inflation</Term><Term Id="88736" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pharmacare</Term><Term Id="40468" IsProceduralTerm="0">Prescription drugs</Term><Term Id="40495" IsProceduralTerm="0">Private health insurance</Term><Term Id="40670" IsProceduralTerm="1">Report stage</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="13141449" Hour="20" Minute="48"><Person><FirstName>Chris</FirstName><LastName>d'Entremont</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>West Nova</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="13141479" Hour="20" Minute="58"><Person><FirstName>Yasir</FirstName><LastName>Naqvi</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Ottawa Centre</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="13141525" EventId="12780216" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12780216/?ml=en" Sequence="512" Page="24179" PdfPage="99" TypeId="38" Date="2024-05-30" Hour="20" Minute="59" Second="44" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=13141525" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%2030%202024%20%208:59PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=13141525"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>	Motions in Amendment</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12780216"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8434028">Mr. Speaker, with respect to the hon. member, who I do respect a lot, I did not suggest what he just said.</ParaText><ParaText id="8434029"> What I was saying is, if there is a gap in the system, the gaps can be filled in many different ways, and we need to solve the problem rather than giving a big promise that we know is not going to be delivered upon.

In December of last year, a Leger poll indicated that only 18% of Canadians thought the establishment of a national pharmacare program was a health care priority. </ParaText><ParaText id="8371616">It may come as a surprise to the Liberals and the NDP, but Canadians are worried about rising prices on everything, due in large part to the carbon tax. When people are worried about being able to feed their family, pay the rent or mortgage and put gas in their car so they can get to work, they do not spend much time thinking about a drug plan that does not cover the medications they need. </ParaText><ParaText id="8371617">Canadians were hoping the Liberals could get it right. That turns out to have been a false hope. On this issue, as on many others, the Liberals are proving once again to have no idea what they are doing. The Liberal idea of pharmacare is restricted to just two types of medication. If one suffers from heart disease, one is out of luck. Heart disease is the second-leading cause of death in Canada, but medication for it would not be covered. </ParaText><ParaText id="8371618">The Liberals' approach to pharmacare reminds me of their approach to Canadian liquid natural gas, or LNG. When the chancellor of Germany came to Canada looking to buy Canadian LNG, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told him there was no business case for such exports. That was a huge surprise to those companies looking to expand their markets. </ParaText><ParaText id="8371619">Not only is there a business case for Canadian LNG, but there is a moral one as well. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, countries are looking to replace Russian LNG and have turned to Canada, only to be told by the Canadian government that it does not want to sell Canadian LNG. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> needs to learn that when there is a customer willing to buy the product, there is indeed a business case to support it. If Germany and Japan and Greece want to buy Canadian LNG, why would we not want to sell it to them? </ParaText><ParaText id="8371620">A previous prime minister asked farmers, “Why should I sell your wheat?” This tells buyers there is not a business case to sell them the product they are asking for, while at the same time offering Canadians a pharmacare program they did not ask for, a plan so flawed it is unlikely to work. </ParaText><ParaText id="8371621">This is the government that promised a firearms buyback program four years ago. So far, it has not managed to launch it, yet it wants Canadians to believe it has the skills necessary to design and implement a pharmacare program. Put simply, what is being offered is not pharmacare.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8371622">It is just another Liberal election gimmick, a promise they will campaign on in 2025, hoping that voters will not look at how many promises they have already broken. Anyone who has looked at the current state of drug coverage in Canada is concerned by this attempt to create additional bureaucracy. We already have some public drug plans; they do not seem to be as good as the private ones. Private drug insurance plans cover many more different medications than public plans do. The difference varies by province, but, on average, private coverage is 51% more extensive than its public counterpart is. In Quebec, the figure is 59.6%. Then there are the delays. Once a drug is approved by Health Canada, it takes an average of 226 days for a private insurer to approve the coverage. By contrast, it takes 732 days for approval by Health Canada, or a little over three times as long, for a public plan to add a drug to its list of covered treatments. These figures do not paint a rosy picture of the ability of public insurance to meet the Canadians' needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371623">The marriage contract between the Liberals and the NDP required that the bill come before us last year. It did not. It took the Liberals two years to come up with the legislation, a bill that seems to have been put together without much thought, just to meet a deadline. Given how weak the bill is, I can only imagine what the first draft looked like. Maybe it was just one line, such as “We promise to look at establishing a pharmacare program in the hopes people will vote for us before we have to deliver.” Wait, is that not what Bill <Document DbId="12924814" Type="3">C-64</Document> is?</ParaText><ParaText id="8371624">After almost nine years of misgovernment, incompetence and mismanagement from the Liberal-NDP coalition, Canadians have lost all faith in the government's ability to discharge its responsibilities. What is the cost of this national pharmacare program? With two years to look into it, the Liberals either did not think to ask or are afraid to tell Canadians just how much more they want to raise taxes to pay for a plan that would benefit almost no one.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371625">The bill is a public relations exercise by an utterly desperate government that is disliked by more and more Canadians every day. The inability of the Liberals to deliver on their promises is well known. Already, two provinces have opted out of this program. There is no indication that other provinces are interested. One would have thought that, in attempting to create a national program in an area of provincial jurisdiction, the Liberals would have consulted with the provinces. One might have expected that they would have hearings and consultations with stakeholders to see what exists now, what needs to be improved and the best way to do that. As far as I can tell, all they did was ask the NDP the minimum they could promise to keep the NDP's support.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371626"> Can the <Affiliation DbId="300010" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> tell us what impact the bill will have on the 27 million Canadians who rely on privately administered workplace plans? If he is an honest man, he cannot, because he does not know. There was no consultation with the insurance industries when the bill was being drafted. Maybe he felt there was no need to check the facts. A promise had been made by the NDP, and the Liberals had to deliver. The needs and wishes for the Canadian people were not worthy of consideration. What is not worthy of consideration is this sad attempt at legislation; Canadians deserve much better than that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="236699" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare</Term><Term Id="38425" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="55211" IsProceduralTerm="0">Confidence in government</Term><Term Id="62794" IsProceduralTerm="0">Cost of living</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39977" IsProceduralTerm="0">Health care system</Term><Term Id="39690" IsProceduralTerm="0">Inflation</Term><Term Id="40126" IsProceduralTerm="0">Natural gas</Term><Term Id="88736" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pharmacare</Term><Term Id="40468" IsProceduralTerm="0">Prescription drugs</Term><Term Id="40495" IsProceduralTerm="0">Private health insurance</Term><Term Id="64413" IsProceduralTerm="0">Public consultation</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="13071837" Hour="21" Minute="37"><Person><FirstName>Lisa</FirstName><LastName>Hepfner</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Hamilton Mountain</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="13071640" Hour="21" Minute="48"><Person><FirstName>Mark</FirstName><LastName>Gerretsen</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Kingston and the Islands</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="13071641" EventId="12723430" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12723430/?ml=en" Sequence="518" Page="23101" PdfPage="103" TypeId="38" Date="2024-05-06" Hour="21" Minute="51" Second="46" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=13071641" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%20%206%202024%20%209:51PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=13071641"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Orders of the Day</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Committees of the House [Justice and Human Rights]</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="12723430"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8371644">Madam Speaker, the question before us is not just whether the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist entity. Its actions over the past four decades are such that such a designation is logical. It is also long overdue, and that may be why the government has so far refused to act. Having ignored past pleas from Iranian experts and from other Canadians, the Liberals are too embarrassed to admit their mistake and do the right thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371645">Following the protest in Iran, since the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, Conservatives have been calling on the Liberal government to support the Iranian people's fight for a free and democratic Iran by listing the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code of Canada. The Liberals refused.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371646">The murder of Jina Mahsa Amini was just one on the long list of violations of human rights committed by the Iranian regime. The torture and death of Montrealer Zahra Kazemi, the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari, the imprisonment of lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and the shooting down of Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752, which killed dozens of Canadians, are examples of a regime that has no respect for its own citizens or for those of other countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371647">The IRGC is a part of this regime and is instrumental to its continued existence. The IRGC has terrorized the people of Iran for decades and has openly declared support for other terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas, both listed in Canada as terrorist entities.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371648">In June 2018, the government, including the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, voted to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity. Despite the motion being approved by the House of Commons, and despite the IRGC downing flight 752 and killing Canadians, the government has yet to list this organization as a terrorist entity. To me, this is shameful. Does the government not understand that Canada needs to take a stand for what is right?</ParaText><ParaText id="8371649">This government's level of hypocrisy has been so big that it does not walk its talk. It does not do what it needs to do. It makes promises, and it breaks them. This is how hypocritical the government has been on this very important issue of protecting Canadians and on making sure that Canada stands where it is right to be.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371650">It was a little more than four years ago when the IRGC shot down flight 752, killing 176 people, including 55 Canadians and 30 permanent residents. This was a mass murder of Canadians. Countries have gone to war over less than that.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371651">The families of those killed in that attack received sympathy from the Liberal government but nothing was done to bring the perpetrators to judgment. Nothing was done to stop them from operating in Canada however they see fit.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371652">There is no doubt that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. There is no doubt that the IRGC is one of the prime movers of Iranian terrorist policy and action. There is no reason for Canada to sit by and do nothing. There are an estimated 700 Iranian Agents operating in Canada. If one asks Iranian Canadians whether they feel comfortable speaking up against the regime, they will tell one stories of harassment for their extended families, not only back in Iran, but also here on Canadian soil.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371653">Two years ago, CSIS confirmed that it was investigating what it saw as credible death threats against Canadians coming from inside Iran. In failing to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization, the government could be seen as not caring about the safety and security of Canadian citizens faced with this foreign threat. Certainly, the Liberal government has not sunk so low as to put the protection of terrorist organizations ahead of the safety of Canadians, has it?</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8371654"> Finance Canada officials testified in committee that more than $100 billion is illegally laundered in Canada each year. A leading report recognizes that Canada has become known for snow-washing, given the prominence of money laundering here. I should not need to remind the Liberals that combatting money laundering is a federal responsibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371655">With his lackadaisical attitude, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has allowed criminal organizations, including the IRGC terrorist organization, to take advantage of soft-on-crime Liberal policies. Because of the Liberals' refusal to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity, we have no way of knowing how much of the Iranian regime's illegal money laundering in Canada goes undetected. Finance Canada officials have admitted that the government does not know whether the IRGC is fundraising for terrorist activities through the Canadian charitable sector. Simply put, the government is not doing its job.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371656">Common-sense Conservatives have put forward real solutions to mitigate money laundering in Canada. Conservative Bill <Document DbId="11875545" Type="4">C-289</Document> proposes changes to the Criminal Code to make it easier to catch and convict criminals laundering money in Canada. That would include IRGC agents. However, the NDP-Liberal coalition voted against the bill. The failure of the government to take terrorism and money laundering seriously allows for murderous entities like the IRGC to operate freely in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371657">The government needs to wake up and finally list the IRGC as a terrorist organization. To do so would bring us in line with our allies, countries such as the United States, that understand the seriousness of this situation, even if Canada's government does not. Other countries understand that an organization that has involved itself in conflicts in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria, should not be allowed to freely export violence and chaos.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371658">The IRGC is open in its support for Hamas and Hezbollah, two organizations that have been recognized as terrorist entities. It does not make sense that the organization that funds the activities of Hamas and Hezbollah should not be called to account for its terrorist actions. What we are discussing here is an organization with a history of exporting violence and mayhem as it seeks to destabilize other countries in the region. Not only that, but this is an organization that is used as a tool of state-sponsored torture and oppression against its own citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371659">We have talked about this in the House before. The will of the House is to have the IRGC listed as a terrorist organization here in Canada. Apparently, though, despite the overwhelming evidence, that is not the will of the Liberal government. I do not understand the reasons for its inaction. It is not as if it believes that it should sponsor terrorism and terrorist organizations. If it does not believe the reports from CSIS or Finance Canada, it should say so. Canadians deserve an explanation for years of Liberal inaction.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371660">The time for empty words and hollow announcements is over. It is time for the government to take action, support the Iranian people's struggles for freedom, do the right thing, and list the IRGC as a terrorist entity in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="233825" IsProceduralTerm="0">8510-441-359 "Mesures to protect Canadians"</Term><Term Id="96551" IsProceduralTerm="0">Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution</Term><Term Id="219671" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-289, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (identity verification)</Term><Term Id="237917" IsProceduralTerm="0">Concurrence in Committee Reports No. 55</Term><Term Id="38740" IsProceduralTerm="0">Crime and criminality</Term><Term Id="39367" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government accountability</Term><Term Id="39627" IsProceduralTerm="0">Identity</Term><Term Id="55041" IsProceduralTerm="0">Iran</Term><Term Id="40049" IsProceduralTerm="0">Money laundering</Term><Term Id="40116" IsProceduralTerm="0">National security</Term><Term Id="212778" IsProceduralTerm="0">Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights</Term><Term Id="41113" IsProceduralTerm="0">Terrorism and terrorists</Term><Term Id="65349" IsProceduralTerm="0">Terrorist entities watch lists</Term><Term Id="200200" IsProceduralTerm="0">Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="13071602" Hour="21" Minute="51"><Person><FirstName>Alexandra</FirstName><LastName>Mendès</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Brossard—Saint-Lambert</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="13071825" Hour="22" Minute="01"><Person><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="13071560" EventId="12723439" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12723439/?ml=en" Sequence="520" Page="23102" PdfPage="104" TypeId="38" Date="2024-05-06" Hour="22" Minute="02" Second="48" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=13071560" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%20%206%202024%2010:02PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=13071560"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Orders of the Day</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Committees of the House [Justice and Human Rights]</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12723439"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8371664"> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="278442" Type="2">Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Affiliation> for the excellent question and his work on these issues and many other issues of human rights and security for all communities in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="8371665"> Based on the record of the government, I will not hold my breath.

We know about the suffering and the fear; many do not even want to go back to visit with their parents or their families back home, and they fear that the regime has agents on Canadian soil and other international grounds to go after their own citizens who speak of freedom. The regime has no limits whatsoever regarding who they want to reach and how far they are willing to go. That is why the problem is at our doorstep right now; we must, for once, protect Canadians on Canadian soil.

I can only conclude that no one in the government actually considered the contents. Maybe they were too busy watching television to think about managing the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361774">I must confess that I do not watch much television. When I do, I watch documentaries or live sports events. Two of the things that I avoid completely are reality television and game shows. To me, there is very little reality involved, and the games do not seem to be all that real to me.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361775"> As a result, I have to admit that I have never watched the show <I>Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</I>, which aired more than 15 years ago. It was a short-lived program with only five episodes made. The idea was to have a panel ask questions from elementary school textbooks to see if the contestants were smarter than a fifth grader. The top prize was a million dollars, tax-free. The idea probably offends the Liberal members opposite. They do not believe that anything should be tax-free, ever.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361776"> Contestants on the show have to answer questions about Canadian history, Canadian geography and Canadian culture. However, history, geography and culture were not the only categories covered on the show. There was also mathematics, which may be the reason no Liberal MP ever appeared on the program. When it comes to math, budget 2024 shows very clearly that the Liberals are nowhere near as smart as a fifth grader. </ParaText><ParaText id="8361777">When children are in fifth grade, math is pretty simple: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It is not rocket science. Fifth graders know that if they receive a weekly allowance from their parents, they must spend that money wisely. Common sense tells them that they cannot spend more than they have. There is no such thing as deficit spending to a ten year old. </ParaText><ParaText id="8361778">If they spend all their money, Mom and Dad will tell them that they have to wait until next week to get any more. They are not made of money. They have to live within their means and they expect their children to learn how to do that also, especially as they feel financially stressed by all the extra taxes the government has piled on them.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361779"> If children want some shiny toy that costs more than their weekly allowance, then they have to learn to save until they can afford to buy it. Stores are reluctant to extend credit to a ten year old, especially one who has not learned the value of saving. </ParaText><ParaText id="8361780">As I look at this budget, I wish the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> could go back in time and become a fifth grader once again. It is apparent that she and the Liberal Party failed to learn some important lessons in childhood, and now it is all Canadians who are paying for their inability to understand basic math.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361781">A fifth grader could tell us that money does not magically appear. It does not grow on trees. We cannot just pick up loose bills on the sidewalk. A fifth grader could tell us that spending more money to pay the interest on the national debt than we have for health care is a recipe for disaster. Adding more debt does not fix the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361782">I will not delve deeply into economic theory here. However, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has asked Canadians to forgive him for not thinking about monetary policy, and it would probably be wrong of me to expect his caucus to have any more interest in such matters.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361783"> I must say, though, that there have been some changes over the past eight years in the way the government approaches its responsibility to manage the nation's finances. No longer does the government think it is possible to pluck numbers out of thin air, put them in a spreadsheet and magically produce a budget that balances itself. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8361784"> Fifth graders could tell us that a deficit is not just a line on a piece of paper. It is a debt, borrowed money that has to be repaid at some point. They would also tell us that until that debt is paid interest will be charged.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361785"> In simple terms that even a Liberal could understand, running a budgetary deficit costs money. If interest has to be paid on a debt, then there is less money for the things that government is supposed to do for Canadians, things like health care.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361786"> Where does the government find money to pay its debts? It raises taxes. In other words, it charges Canadians for something they did not ask for and for some reason expects them to be happy to pay.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361787"> Parents who explain to their fifth graders how important it is for individuals and families to live within their means are being undermined by a government that spends and spends, while expecting someone else to pay its bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361788"> This budget would increase government spending and taxes and would bring us no closer to a balanced budget than we have been at any time in almost nine years of Liberal fiscal mismanagement. Apparently the Liberals' coalition partners in the NDP approve of this highway of economic ruin. This budget would bring in $40 billion of costly new spending that Canadians cannot afford.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361789">In 2022, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said that the budget would be balanced by the year 2027. In 2023, the date was revised to 2028. Why do the Liberals not just admit that they have no idea how to balance the budget, since magic is not working?</ParaText><ParaText id="8361790">Before the Liberals were elected in 2015, their leader suggested that perhaps his government would run modest deficits, about $10 billion annually before returning to the balanced books that he inherited from the previous Conservative government. We all know what happened. Record deficits followed record deficits to create a national debt never seen before in the history of Canada. With this latest budget, the Liberal-NDP government is farther than ever from doing so.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361791"> What we have now is a government that will spend more money next year servicing the debt than on health care. There is no sense in that, except perhaps to the members opposite.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361792">Canada's per capita GDP is now lower than it was six years ago. While other countries have grown their economies, Canadians are poorer. The government's solution is inflationary spending and more taxes. It needs to go back to the fifth grade.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361793">There is a glimmer of hope. Soon we will have a Conservative government with members who are indeed smarter than a fifth grader. Conservatives will balance the books, making the spendthrift <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and her fiscally unaware boss a bad memory.</ParaText><ParaText id="8361794">The common-sense Conservative plan will axe the carbon tax, balance the budget and build homes, not bureaucracy, to bring lower prices to Canadians. Even a fifth grader knows that the Liberal government is not worth the cost.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="62733" IsProceduralTerm="0">Balanced budget</Term><Term Id="237275" IsProceduralTerm="0">Budget 2024 (April 16, 2024)</Term><Term Id="38323" IsProceduralTerm="1">Budget debates</Term><Term Id="38957" IsProceduralTerm="0">Economic conditions</Term><Term Id="39387" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government expenditures</Term><Term Id="39690" IsProceduralTerm="0">Inflation</Term><Term Id="40541" IsProceduralTerm="0">Public debt</Term><Term Id="237267" IsProceduralTerm="0">Ways and Means No. 20</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="13047804" Hour="11" Minute="30"><Person><FirstName>Dave</FirstName><LastName>Epp</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Chatham-Kent—Leamington</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="13048722" Hour="11" Minute="41"><Person><FirstName>Adam</FirstName><LastName>van Koeverden</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Milton</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="13048715" EventId="12704141" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12704141/?ml=en" Sequence="87" Page="22758" PdfPage="18" TypeId="38" Date="2024-04-30" Hour="11" Minute="44" Second="06" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=13048715" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Apr%2030%202024%2011:44AM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=13048715"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>The Budget [Financial Statement of Minister of Finance]</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12704141"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8361811">Mr. Speaker, I would excuse the hon. member opposite.

As such, 158 lost their lives and more than 2,000 were injured. For the families of those men and women still dealing with the after-effects of the long period of conflict, the seizing of the country once more by the Taliban in 2021 was saddening. It seems like their sacrifices had been in vain. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109178">The Taliban was, for good reason, listed by Canada as a terrorist group in 2013. Its rule is marked by limited rights for women and minorities, and a history of human rights abuses. The Taliban's return to power triggered a mass exodus of Afghans inside and outside the country, sparking a refugee crisis. Many had to flee for fear of reprisals, persecution and restrictions on individual freedoms. The Liberal government made a lot of promises, especially to aid those Afghans who had worked with Canadian troops during our combat mission there, but, sadly, many of those promises turned out to be words and not actions. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109179">It is not only those who worked with Canada’s military who have suffered as a result of Canada’s response to the latest takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Internally displaced persons are also in urgent need of help. They lack access to basic needs such as food, clean water, health care and education. I am pleased that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has seen fit to firmly denounce the Taliban and reject any recognition or legitimization of its control over Afghan territory. A terrorist organization that achieves by force what it cannot achieve at the ballot box is not a legitimate government.</ParaText><ParaText id="8109180"> It makes sense for the committee to denounce the Taliban system of gender discrimination, systemic violence targeting minority communities, reprisals against former members of the Afghan National Security and Defence Forces, attacks on freedom of the press and other violations of fundamental human rights. The more than two years since the Taliban seized power have been two years of broken promises. In 2021 a Taliban spokesman promised that his government was going to allow women to work and study, and that women would be very active in society. The reality is that not only were women banned from attending university, education for girls is banned beyond the sixth grade. The Taliban has also banned women from working in all non-governmental organizations. According to the International Labour Organization, women's participation in the labour force dropped by 25 per cent between August 2021 and March 2023.</ParaText><ParaText id="8109181">Conservatives have long been calling for action to hold those in power in Afghanistan accountable for their actions against the Afghan populace, the international community and, most importantly, Afghan women and children.</ParaText><ParaText id="8109182">The Taliban have neglected the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, leaving the population suffering from a malnutrition crisis and a rapid increase in acute hunger. The number of people suffering has increased exponentially, from 14 million in 2021 to approximately 20 million this year. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109183">From 2001 to 2014, our Canadian troops heard first-hand the stories from Afghan citizens of repression under the Taliban. Our troops fought, not only for Canada but also for the good, innocent people they grew to love in their time there. Canadian troops put their lives on the line, not only for their country but to help Afghan women and children have hope of a better life. Years of conflict and violence led to a humanitarian crisis that shattered the innocence of these people. Life under the Taliban is so much worse than before.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8109184"> We owe it to our veterans and our fallen soldiers to continue the effort towards a better humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. That means not even considering that Taliban rule, by force and fear, is somehow legitimate. To consider recognizing the Taliban government, as some have suggested, would be wrong. It would be rewarding an organization that knows nothing but force and fear and rejects the values Canadians hold in common. To recognize what the Taliban calls a government would be to reward the actions of a terrorist group. Conservatives believe Canada must continue to stand with the Afghan people, oppose the Taliban and engage with civil society and pro-democracy groups who want to restore Afghan freedom and democracy. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109185">I have at times wondered if the Liberal commitment to freedom and human rights is as strong as the Conservative one. As Kabul was falling to the Taliban, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> responded immediately by calling an election. While the Americans were airlifting more than 100,000 desperate people out of Kabul, the Canadian Prime Minister decided to call an unnecessary election instead of providing the leadership Canadians expected and Afghans hoped for. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109186">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to provide a safe haven for 40,000 refugees from Afghanistan. When Canadians heard that promise, they did not dream that it would take more than two years for him to keep that promise. One would think that, faced with a humanitarian crisis, the resettlement process would have been a priority for the government. One would think that, but the Liberals did not. At least Canadians hope they can fulfill the promise by the end of this year. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109187">No wonder so many Afghans felt let down by Canada as the Taliban seized power and began persecuting those they saw as opponents. In Afghanistan’s time of need, the Liberals decided to have an election. It seems like ever since, they have fallen further and further behind in their promise to the humanitarian crisis, both in Afghanistan and in the surrounding countries from which refugees have fled. It is a sorry track record, one they hope Canadians will not notice. </ParaText><ParaText id="8109188">Having failed the people of Afghanistan in so many ways, it is important that, at the very least, Canada continues to stand up for the values that we share. Those include religious freedom and gender equality, two things the Taliban denies to those under its rule. More than just denying rights, the Taliban looks to export its agenda as it continues to coordinate and facilitate attacks with other terrorist groups such as al Qaeda, the IRGC and ISIS.</ParaText><ParaText id="8109189">The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights believes that the Taliban must remain a listed terrorist organization.

Who could possibly think a healthy environment, especially with clean air and water, is a bad idea? Certainly not me.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087100">That said, Bill <Document DbId="11472666" Type="4">C-219</Document>, an act to enact the Canadian environmental bill of rights and to make related amendments to other acts, falls far short of what we as a country need. It is my hope that, working together, we can make amendments to this legislation to make it something Canadians can be proud of.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087101">None of us in this House lives in a vacuum. When we consider legislation, we know what we are doing is not an academic exercise in political science. What we say here and what we do here have implications that go beyond this room. That is why we debate proposed legislation and policies. We need to try, within the best of our abilities, to get things right, and there is probably no issue on which there is a greater need to get things right than when we are dealing with the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087102">As a father, l want to do what is right and to set an example for my two sons. I want them to be able to look back on my time in Parliament and feel their father spent his time doing good, that he was working for their future and for the future of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="8087103">Of course, there are sometimes things over which we have little or no control. Climate change, for example, is a global issue. The parties in this House, though we may differ on our approach to the issue, are in agreement that Canada is a very small player when it comes to dealing with climate change. That does not mean we should not do our part. Rather, we need to understand that our best will only produce positive results on a global scale if we can convince other nations of the seriousness of the need for immediate action. </ParaText><ParaText id="8087104">Let us take a look at Bill <Document DbId="11472666" Type="4">C-219</Document>, what it would do and what it would not do and consider how we can improve it.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087105">Bill <Document DbId="11472666" Type="4">C-219</Document> would enact the Canadian environmental bill of rights, which provides that all residents have the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment; the right to reasonable, timely and affordable access to information regarding the environment; the right to effective, informed and timely public participation in decision-making regarding the environment; the right to bring a matter regarding the protection of the environment before courts or tribunals; and the right to request a review of any act of Parliament respecting the environment, any instrument made under such an act or any environmental policy of the Government of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="8087106">Bill <Document DbId="11472666" Type="4">C-219</Document> would also amend the Canadian Bill of Rights to provide that “the right of the individual to life, liberty and security of the person includes the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment”. It is important that we safeguard the right of present and future generations of Canadians to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment. We also need to confirm the Government of Canada's duty to protect the environment so as to protect the collective interests of Canadians in the quality of the environment for the benefit of present and future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087107">It is also important to ensure that all Canadians have access to adequate information regarding the environment, justice in an environmental context and effective mechanisms for participating in environmental decision-making. This is to enhance public confidence in the administration and enforcement of environmental laws, including by allowing individuals to request reviews of laws, to apply for investigations of offences and to bring environmental protection actions. </ParaText><ParaText id="8087108">Protection of our natural environment has long been a core Conservative principle. We want to conserve and strengthen what is good. As we know, it was a Conservative prime minister, the right hon. Brian Mulroney, who took strong action to stop the acid rain problem. When confronted with a climate problem, Conservatives know how to get the job done.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8087109">I am encouraged that Bill <Document DbId="11472666" Type="4">C-219</Document> calls for increased transparency in information relating to environmental matters. Conservatives have long called for government transparency and access to information.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087110">However, I am concerned that, under this bill, decision-making power on environmental matters would be transferred from the legislature to the courts. This seems unwise, as I am not convinced that the judiciary has the necessary expertise to delve into policy issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087111">To my friend opposite, who I am sure is about to suggest that many in this House are also not policy experts, I say that the responsibility still resides with us. I would suggest that we spend more time considering policy than most judges. Policy debates should happen through representative institutions and electoral politics. Courts are not well equipped to examine policy instruments, nor do they have the expertise to evaluate the consequences of various policy options. Not only do they not have the expertise to do so, but they are not elected officials either, and it is not within the purview of the court to make such decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087112">We have a very recent example of the problems that can ensue when the House delegates its responsibility to someone else. The Liberal government, in its wisdom, or more accurately, in its lack of wisdom, has tasked the CRTC with implementing provisions of the Online Streaming Act. As a result, streaming companies are restricting what Canadians can access online, and the government does not know what to do as it tries to force them to pay what amounts to a tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087113">Furthermore, the CRTC, which has no expertise in these matters, has announced that it is putting all new radio licence applications and any complaints relating to radio on hold for two years. Meanwhile, it is trying to figure out how it is supposed to regulate what Canadians can and cannot see online. It is abandoning its core functions to take on this task, because this government had no idea of the effects of its legislation or what it is doing. Given that experience, is it any wonder that I have concerns about transferring decision-making functions on environmental matters to the judiciary? We have judges to enforce our laws. This bill, it seems to me, transforms them into a legislative authority. That is going too far.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087114">I think everyone in the House agrees on the need for a healthy and ecologically balanced environment. We also agree on the need for more transparency and public input. Where we disagree is on how to combat climate change. The Liberals believe that they can tax Canadians until they can no longer afford to heat their houses or drive their cars. They think that will solve Canada's emissions problem. In Canada, with our cold weather climate, our options are not as varied as they are in some other countries. It is important that we focus on the development of new technologies and Canadian ingenuity as the key to lessening, then eliminating, our dependence on fossil fuels.</ParaText><ParaText id="8087115">Conservatives believe that, in order to have a strong economy and maintain good health, Canada must have strong, coordinated and achievable environmental policies. The Conservative Party believes that responsible exploration, development, conservation and renewal of our environment are vital to our continued well-being as a nation and as individuals. An environmental bill of rights is a nice idea in theory. This bill, though, needs a lot of work to make it acceptable.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="214111" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-219, An Act to enact the Canadian Environmental Bill of Rights and to make related amendments to other Acts</Term><Term Id="93061" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental law</Term><Term Id="39075" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental protection</Term><Term Id="39786" IsProceduralTerm="0">Judiciary</Term><Term Id="40497" IsProceduralTerm="1">Private Members' Bills</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12772209" Hour="18" Minute="58"><Person><FirstName>Laurel</FirstName><LastName>Collins</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Victoria</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12772222" Hour="19" Minute="17"><Person><FirstName>Heather</FirstName><LastName>McPherson</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Edmonton Strathcona</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="12737368" Title="Hansard -

As someone who values the work of labour unions, a person who appreciates the historic impact they have had on improving the rights and working conditions of Canadian workers, I feel it is sad that we have to consider whether replacement workers should be allowed in federally regulated workplaces.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059429">The use of replacement workers comes about when either a unionized workforce has gone on strike or an employer has locked out its workers. In either case, there are no real winners, so what would bring workers or employers to such a position? Why would they feel it necessary to take such drastic measures if nobody wins in such a situation? The answer is simple. If it seems that Canada has seen more labour strife than at any other time in recent history, the reason is simple. The policies of the Liberal government have made it difficult for Canadian workers to make ends meet.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059430">Workers expect government to look out for their best interests. We have a government that apparently does not understand what is good for people. We see record inflation, food prices spiralling out of control and the dream of home ownership dying for millions of Canadians. Those who are lucky enough to find a place to rent have discovered that rents have also skyrocketed. What is the Liberals' response to these economic problems? Its response includes inflationary deficits and higher taxes, government spending that seems out of control, the highest national debt in the history of Canada and no ideas of how to fix the mess they have created. When the carbon tax is increasing the cost of everything for everyone, housing costs have doubled, mortgage costs are 150% higher than they were before the Liberal government took office and half of Canadians say that they are $200 or less from going broke, it is no wonder workers feel abandoned by the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059431">The Conservative Party supports the rights of workers to organize democratically, bargain collectively and peacefully withdraw and withhold their services from an employer. We also believe the government should work with unions and employers in areas of federal jurisdiction to develop dispute settlement mechanisms and encourage their use to avoid or minimize disruption to services for Canadians. Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document> will apply to about one million workers in federally regulated industries, many of which are sectors that are critical to national life. For this reason alone, it is important to study this legislation at committee to hear from witnesses, both those who are in favour and those who are against the legislation, to allow members to better understand the implications of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059432">I am sure the Liberals will tell me that such a study is not really necessary, that they know what they are doing and that this legislation should be passed with a minimum of scrutiny. After all, the Liberals tell us they know what is best for the country, but anyone who questions their dogma, they view as a heretic. In the church that is the Liberal Party, I would be a heretic. I have seen too many Liberal ministers telling Canadians that they know what is best for them when they obviously do not. The government would like us to believe that the Liberals are infallible, but all too often the truth is that they do not have a clue what they are doing. That may be true also with this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059433">I would think that unions would view Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document> as correcting a tilted playing field that has been in favour of employers. They expect that, once this act is passed, the strikes and lockouts will be shorter. In the same way, I would think employers would see Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document> as favouring unions, with the potential of prolonged strikes and lockouts. These are conflicting viewpoints, and whichever one we might adopt may depend on our view of the current balance of power between unions and employers.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8059434">Our job in the House is to find a way to craft legislation that is fair to both workers and employers, which is another reason to ensure that we consider the bill carefully so we do not have to return to the subject to fix mistakes made by a rushed process. When the <Affiliation DbId="300027" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> spoke in the House just a couple of days ago, he said that consideration of the bill would not be rushed and that it is one of the most significant changes to federal collective bargaining that Canada has ever seen. I am glad he sees the need for a long and hard examination of the proposed legislation. We all want more deals to be made at the bargaining table. Strikes and lockouts are harmful to workers, employers and the Canadian economy as a whole. The Liberals seem to think that the bill would result in fewer labour disruptions. It will be interesting to hear what witnesses say when Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document> is examined at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059435">One of the areas that may be contentious is allowing employers to hire replacement workers as long as they deal solely with the situation that presents or could reasonably be expected to present an imminent or serious threat. Those threats could be to the life, health or safety of any person; destruction of or serious damage to the employer's property or premises; or serious environmental damage affecting the employer's property or premises. Allowing replacement workers in such situations seems reasonable. The problem I foresee is one of determining exactly what the situations are when such hiring would be allowed. I would expect unions would quite naturally attempt to limit the use of replacement workers, while employers would try to stretch the definition as much as possible, but maybe I am wrong. Maybe employers and unions alike would be reasonable in all situations and there would be a clear understanding of what represents a safety threat, property damage or environmental damage.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059436">More likely, the Canada Industrial Relations Board would find itself much busier if this legislation is passed, as it tries to work out the details of the legislation in practice as opposed to in theory. No one, not workers, not employers and not the public, likes labour disruptions. In an ideal world, they would not happen. Of course, in an ideal world, workers would not have to worry about having to make a choice between paying the rent and paying for groceries. In an ideal world, Canadians would not be wondering why their government was offering tax exemptions on one form of home heating fuel and not on the others that contribute less to greenhouse gas emissions. In an ideal world, food bank use would be decreasing instead of increasing, and Canadians would not have to worry whether they can afford the ever-increasing cost of food.</ParaText><ParaText id="8059437">However, under the current government, we do not live in an ideal world. We live in a world where the Liberal carbon tax keeps going up, increasing the cost of everything. Canadian workers and employers alike are feeling squeezed by a government that has shown by its fiscal policies that it does not care about either of them. Unions and businesses may have differing views about Bill <Document DbId="12692679" Type="3">C-58</Document>, but they do have one thing in common: They all know that it is time for the Liberal government to go.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="232444" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-58, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Canada Industrial Relations Board Regulations, 2012</Term><Term Id="62794" IsProceduralTerm="0">Cost of living</Term><Term Id="93524" IsProceduralTerm="0">Federally regulated employers and employees</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39690" IsProceduralTerm="0">Inflation</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="41000" IsProceduralTerm="0">Strikebreakers</Term><Term Id="41001" IsProceduralTerm="0">Strikes and lockouts</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12736012" Hour="12" Minute="36"><Person><FirstName>Gerald</FirstName><LastName>Soroka</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Yellowhead</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12736019" Hour="12" Minute="46"><Person><FirstName>Chris</FirstName><LastName>Bittle</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>St. Catharines</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12736020" EventId="12460904" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12460904/?ml=en" Sequence="200" Page="19025" PdfPage="29" TypeId="38" Date="2023-11-24" Hour="12" Minute="46" Second="59" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12736020" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Nov%2024%202023%2012:46PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12736020"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Canada Labour Code</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12460904"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="8059440">Mr. Speaker, I did not say it was unnecessary; I said I wish it were unnecessary.

I believe in Canada and in Canadians. I know that we are some of the most creative people in the world. I know that there is no one who surpasses us in business acumen or in the quality of the products we make. I also know that, on a level playing field, Canadians will always succeed. Our strength is our people. We are so much more than the hewers of wood and drawers of water of our colonial past. We are energetic and innovative, and we have been energized by the input of people and cultures from around the globe. Canadians are not afraid of free trade; we welcome it.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002494">Before the people of Edmonton Manning asked me to be their representative in the House, I was a businessman. Arriving in Canada as an immigrant with little more than the clothes on my back, I took the opportunity that this country gives. I worked hard and built a business that had customers around the world. Anyone who has experience in international business will say that there seems to be no end to the possible problems and pitfalls. All too often, in too many places, the rules of business do not seem fair. A free trade agreement is designed to make rules fair and to open up opportunities for business people in the countries it covers. A free trade agreement tells the world that the countries signing it are not afraid of fair and honest competition, and that they believe in the ability of their citizens and want them to prosper. I know first-hand that Canada and Canadians can compete with whatever the world has to offer. I know that we have the people and the brain power to shine on the world stage.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002495">The ties between Canada and Ukraine are long-standing and historic. It was under a Conservative government that, on December 2, 1991, Canada became the first western country to recognize Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. It was under a Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, that Canada undertook Operation Unifier, the Canadian Armed Forces mission to bolster the capabilities of the armed forces of Ukraine through the provision of critical military training. Ukraine has been so successful in the past two years in fighting against the invader in part because of that partnership with Canada. That partnership is more than a military alliance; it is also about trade. It was Conservatives who successfully negotiated the current Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002496">What would the bill before us do? Among other things, it is designed to:</ParaText><ParaText id="8002497"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) promote, through the elimination of barriers to trade in goods and services, the expansion of reciprocal trade and the strengthening of economic relations between Canada and Ukraine in order to create opportunities for economic development;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="8002498"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(c) promote conditions of fair competition affecting trade between Canada and Ukraine;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="8002499"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(d) ensure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="8002500">As a former businessman, I appreciate that the word “predictable” is very comforting. What any business person wants to know is that the rules are solid, that the ground does not shift in the middle of a deal. In a world where there seems to be an increasing number of variables, where so much is uncertain, it is important to have a predictable commercial framework if we want business to invest and spur on the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002501">I am a big fan of fair competition. As I said, I believe in Canada and in Canadians. I think we can hold our own in a fair competition. Indeed, we can do more than hold our own; we can excel. Canadian businesses are always looking for opportunities for economic development, opportunities for expansion. One of the reasons we have free trade agreements is to create those same opportunities.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="8002502">The legislation before us would update the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement, which was first proposed by the Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The agreement, which came into force on August 1, 2017, eliminated tariffs on 86% of Canada's merchandise exports to Ukraine. In 2022, Canada's merchandise exports to Ukraine totalled $150 million, while merchandise imports from Ukraine were $271 million. As a reflection of the need brought about by Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, Canada's top export to that country in 2022 was armoured vehicles and their parts. Also on the list were fish and seafood, pharmaceuticals, machinery and private donations. Canada top imports from Ukraine were animal and vegetable fats and oils, iron and steel and electricity machinery and equipment. In 2022, Canadian businesses invested $112 million directly in Ukraine.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002503">Canada currently has a $150-million trade deficit with Ukraine. When the Harper government originally negotiated the FTA, it was designed to be an asymmetrical agreement in which Ukraine would initially gain the most benefit. The inclusion of more services trade in the updated FTA, and some of the other changes, should balance out bilateral trade. Especially in this time of conflict, Canada should continue looking for ways to use our economic strength to support the Ukrainian people. That includes exporting Canadian liquid natural gas to break European dependance on natural gas from Russia.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002504">However, the bill before us, despite being called the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement implementation act, 2023, is not really about free trade. It is about hope. It is about the hope that one day, hopefully soon, Vladimir Putin will realize that his brutal invasion of Ukraine is doomed to fail, and the hope that once again there can be peace in the land. It is about the hope of millions of people displaced by fighting who are longing to return home to pick up the pieces of their lives. It is about the hope of a return to a normal where there is no longer the fear of falling bombs. It is about the hope that those areas scarred by war can be rebuilt and restored. It is about the hope that with peace can come renewed prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002505">The agreement is about the future of Canada and the future of Ukraine, about an ongoing partnership that would benefit both countries. Canadians have been impressed with the courage shown by the Ukrainian people in the face of war. Their commitment to freedom and democracy is an inspiration. We want to do what we can to support them in their struggle. Indeed, the worldwide assumption was that in any military confrontation between Vladimir Putin's Russia and Ukraine, the outcome would be a swift and decisive Russian victory. On paper, there was no contest.</ParaText><ParaText id="8002506">The bill is a sign that there is indeed life after war, and it will be a good life. It is important for Canada and all other democracies to show their support for Ukraine in its time of need. We have shown our support militarily. We have shown our support morally.

When we have a problem, it is not the time to be scrambling for solutions. That is why I support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, the national eye care strategy act. I thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278356" Type="2">Humber River—Black Creek</Affiliation> for bringing this matter before the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933713">One of the reasons I like this legislation is that it understands the need for co-operation in health care. It calls on the Minister of Health to establish a national strategy for eye care in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments, as well as indigenous leaders and other health care-related stakeholders. There are approximately eight million Canadians who suffer from some form of degenerative eye disease. That means one in five Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933714">Look around this chamber. Statistically, it is likely that 68 hon. members are afflicted by a degenerative eye disease. Sometimes people are not aware of it. It could be one of us. It could be me.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933715">Fighting Blindness Canada, the largest charitable funder of vision research in Canada, estimates that 75% of eye disease cases are preventable in the event of early diagnosis. That is a sobering number and explains why we need a national eye care strategy. This afflicts one in five Canadians and in most cases is preventable. We would be derelict in our duty if we did not work to address this issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="7933716">The most common eye diseases in Canada include macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. All of those can lead to blindness if not treated in time. The earlier the treatment, the better the chances of a positive outcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933717">The bill calls for a national strategy to identify the training and educational needs of health care practitioners who specialize in ocular care; to promote improved research on prevention and treatment; to promote data sharing between the federal and provincial governments in relation to eye disease prevention; and to facilitate the rapid approval of new treatments used for eye disease. It is not that nothing is being done now; it is that we need to do more. That is why this bill calls upon the Minister of Health to take into consideration existing strategies directed at prevention and treatment of eye disease. A national approach taking into account what is already being done in the provinces should be of benefit to all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933718">This is a health care issue, one that affects the quality of life of millions of Canadians. As I said earlier, we tend to take our eyes for granted. I can think of few things that are more terrifying than slowly going blind, but that is the reality many Canadians are facing, and we have the opportunity in this House to do something about it. If we are serious about health care, then we should be serious about eye care, as our eyes are vitally important to our health.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933719">As well as being a health issue, this is a financial issue. Fighting Blindness Canada estimates that preventable blindness in Canada costs about $33 billion each year, as the hon. member said earlier. That includes $9.5 billion in direct health care costs, $6.1 billion in indirect health care costs and $17.4 billion for the cost of well-being. Admittedly, this is not as much money as the Liberal deficit, but it is still a staggering amount when we stop to think about it. That is the cost of eye disease that could be prevented through early detection and treatment, something that would be enhanced by having a national eye care strategy as outlined in this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933720">Vision loss will usually have a negative impact on an individual's financial health. Along with that comes a loss of independence and reduced quality of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933721">Canada's population is aging, and many eye diseases are age-related. That means the number of individuals living with vision loss is growing. Those numbers will increasingly impact Canada's health system and economy, so it is important that we act now.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7933722">It is important, as the bill states, to “identify the needs of health care professionals for training and guidance on the prevention and treatment of eye disease and to vision rehabilitation;” to “promote research and improve data collection on eye disease prevention and treatment and on vision rehabilitation”; and to “promote information and knowledge sharing between the federal and provincial governments in relation to eye disease prevention and treatment and to vision rehabilitation”. We have the ability to make this a reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933723">Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document> also calls for the designation of the month of February as “Age-Related Macular Degeneration Awareness Month”. I also support that. This designation has been used in other countries as a way to bring the issue to a wider audience. In so many cases of eye disease, prevention starts with awareness. By concentrating on the issue for the month of February, more Canadians will become aware of the eye issues they may face as they age and what can be done in terms of prevention. </ParaText><ParaText id="7933724">All of us age, although most of us cannot imagine what things will look like when we are older. We may think that macular degenerative eye disease is going to happen to someone else and not to us. However, the truth is that it affects too many Canadians. If a person does not suffer from it, probably someone in their family or a close friend or colleague will. </ParaText><ParaText id="7933725">The experts tell me that macular degeneration occurs most often in people over 60 years old, and Canada does have an aging population problem. What is a problem now will only grow larger as the rest of the baby boomer generation moves into retirement. Age is a big factor when it comes to degenerative eye disease. A person in their 50s has about a 2% chance of getting age-related macular degeneration. By the time they reach 75, their chance is about one in three. Yet, as I said, most macular degeneration issues can be prevented with early recognition and treatment, which is why a month spent raising awareness of this issue is so important. </ParaText><ParaText id="7933726">Losing one's eyesight is terrifying to contemplate. Vision loss is an issue that literally affects millions of Canadians. We have the ability to do something to prevent it. There is no reason to delay.</ParaText><ParaText id="7933727">I support Bill <Document DbId="11816445" Type="4">C-284</Document>, the national strategy for eye care act. We need to do what we can to protect the health of Canadians. I encourage members to support the bill. </ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="215287" IsProceduralTerm="0">Age-Related Macular Degeneration Month</Term><Term Id="219543" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-284, An Act to establish a national strategy for eye care</Term><Term Id="219562" IsProceduralTerm="0">National Strategy for Eye Care</Term><Term Id="40497" IsProceduralTerm="1">Private Members' Bills</Term><Term Id="54871" IsProceduralTerm="1">Third reading and adoption</Term><Term Id="96192" IsProceduralTerm="0">Vision health</Term><Term Id="69175" IsProceduralTerm="0">Visual disorders</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12594518" Hour="17" Minute="31"><Person><FirstName>Judy A.</FirstName><LastName>Sgro</LastName><Honorific>Hon.</Honorific><Constituency>Humber River—Black Creek</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12594557" Hour="17" Minute="40"><Person><FirstName>Marie-Hélène</FirstName><LastName>Gaudreau</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Laurentides—Labelle</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="12554075" Title="Hansard - 217" TypeId="37" Date="2023-06-20" Time="10:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/217/HAN217-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="12554001" EventId="12310706" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12310706/?ml=en" Sequence="504" Page="16376" PdfPage="88" TypeId="38" Date="2023-06-20" Hour="20" Minute="54" Second="55" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12554001" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Jun%2020%202023%20%208:54PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12554001"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Canada Business Corporations Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="12310706"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7882652">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question of the member for <Affiliation DbId="278257" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="7882653">He mentioned money laundering and the real estate market.

Now I live in another country known for tall trees, beautiful mountains and magnificent valleys. Canada is my home. I grew up in a country with hot, humid summers and, in the mountain areas, lots of snow in the winter. I moved to a country with hot, humid summers and lots of snow in the winter. Canada is my home.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859421">The people of Lebanon are proud of their history, heritage and symbols. Perhaps none are more famous than the cedars that adorn the national flag. Canadians are proud of their history, heritage and symbols, and they too have a famous tree. The maple leaf on the flag shouts to the world “Canada is here”. In Lebanon, the people have learned to live together in harmony and work together to build a society.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859422">When I came to my new home, Canada, I discovered that the people here had learned to live together to bridge their differences. French, English and first nations laid the cornerstone for a country where language, race and creed are not as important as who we are as a person. Those founding groups have opened the door of this country to the world. Millions have come to Canada looking for a fresh start, including those from Lebanon. I was one of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859423">My story is not unusual. I came to Canada to seek an opportunity that was not possible in Lebanon at that time. The land of my birth had suffered from years of civil war. The rebuilding was going to take time. Jobs and educational opportunities were limited. It made sense to come to Canada, at least for a short period of time. That short time has been more than 30 years now, which is more than half of my life. When I came here, I did not know I was going to fall in love with this country. I am proud of my Lebanese heritage, but Canada is my home now and always.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859424">I am not alone in this feeling. There are more than 200,000 Canadians of Lebanese heritage. We are proud of our background, but prouder still to be a part of the greatest nation on earth. I am also proud to support Bill <Document DbId="11800883" Type="4">S-246</Document> to establish Lebanese heritage month.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859425"> It is time to recognize the contributions Lebanese Canadians have made to this country since the first Lebanese immigrant came to Montreal in 1882, Ibrahim Abu Nadir. His Canadian name was Abraham Bounadere, and he came from Zahlé, a city about 50 kilometres from my hometown Aaiha. I feel a certain kinship with the young man who took a leap of faith to come to Canada, never dreaming what the future would be for the Lebanese people here.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859426">Abraham was the first in the wave of immigrants coming to Canada looking for a better life and new opportunities. The first to come to Canada from Lebanon were mostly men with little education. Everything about the country was new to them, from the language to the climate to the ways of society. They discover that Lebanese values are Canadian values, including hard work, good manners, generosity, courage and honesty. Despite their different background, they found it easy to fit into Canadian society. They brought their families to Canada and built a community.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859427">Those of Lebanese background have become part of the fabric of Canada, and this dominion is stronger because of that. Wherever we Lebanese have found ourselves, we look for ways to strengthen the community. That is another similarity between Canada and Lebanon. Our common values include a desire to serve and work to help those around us.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859428">I am very much aware of the contributions of Lebanese culture and Lebanese people to Canadian society. We have had an impact greater than our numbers. It is a proud heritage, one that has shaped me and made me who I am today. When we think of the impact of Lebanese Canadians on our country, probably one of the first things that comes to most people's minds is business. The entrepreneurial spirit is stronger in Lebanese people. One could say that we prefer to be the boss.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859429">Leon's Furniture comes to mind. It was a small family business started by a Lebanese immigrant, Ablan Leon, more than a century ago. It has now grown to more than 10,000 employees and 80 locations across Canada.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="24" Mn="40">(2440)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7859430">From small restaurants to major corporations, when we look at almost any business in Canada, we find someone of Lebanese background involved. However, it is not just business. When we talk about law, politics, medicine, music, academia or film, Lebanese Canadians have made their mark. Indeed, it was the grandson of a Lebanese immigrant who made one of the greatest Canadian films of all time.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859431">In 1970, working with a shoestring budget, Donald Shebib told the story of a couple of young men from the Maritimes, who felt homesick in their new life in the big city. <I>Goin' Down the Road</I> became an instant classic, a story that was true then and remains true today. It is a story that captures so much of what it means to be Canadian. We are a nation in progress, and sometimes we do not realize that life is pretty good just where we are. Today, many young people still leave Atlantic Canada looking for a new life elsewhere, and they discover that, in a big city, their hopes and dreams are not always fulfilled. However, that does not stop people from hoping, dreaming, persevering or achieving.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859432">Lebanese immigrants and people of Lebanese ancestry, full of hopes, dreams, perseverance and achievement, have been a central part of the Canadian experience for 150 years. We have come to this land from far away, and it has become our home. We are fond of Lebanon. We are enthusiastic about Lebanese culture, and especially Lebanese food. We are also passionate about Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859433">The nation, culture and community that we call Lebanon has been around for millennia. The border of the Lebanese state has sometimes changed to adapt to political fortunes in the Middle East. Lebanon once again became an independent nation on November 22, 1943, 80 years ago this year. It seems to me that this anniversary date makes it appropriate that we designate November in Canada as Lebanese heritage month.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859434">I am proud to speak of my Lebanese heritage. I am prouder still to be able to call myself a Canadian. I love the land of my birth, and I still have family and friends there. However, Canada is not only the present but also the future for me and my family.</ParaText><ParaText id="7859435">Let us celebrate Lebanese heritage month. Let us celebrate the contribution of those early immigrants from Lebanon and their descendants to making Canada the great nation it is today.

There is an expression that says those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. That appears to be true of the government, which has never met a tax it did not want to increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825843">The Liberal government first introduced its clean fuel standard in 2016. The effect on Canadians was noticeable. Some lower- and middle-income homeowners found it difficult to heat their homes due to the price increases associated with this standard. In effect, it was a tax on those who could least afford to pay it.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825844">Three years ago, the Department of the Environment put the direct costs of the clean fuel standard on Canadian households at $2.4 billion, and I am sure it is way more now. The Liberal-NDP plan for the environment is not designed to combat climate change. It is a plan to increase taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825845">The clean fuel regulations require liquid fossil fuel producers to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of the gasoline and diesel they produce and sell for use in Canada. That is a worthy goal, but what happens to producers that do not meet that standard? They will be taxed. What will they do when they are taxed? They will pass the tax on to the consumer in the form of higher prices, which the Liberals do not mind because then they can add more taxes to the higher prices.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825846">With inflation already at historic levels, this new clean fuel regulations tax is a tax that Canadians do not need. Giving more money to the Liberals to help them mismanage the Canadian economy and the federal budget is not the way to fight climate change.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825847">After eight years of the Liberal government, Canadians have seen their lives become more unaffordable thanks to the inflationary carbon tax. Now the Liberals are bringing in a second carbon tax. Do they not understand that they are making life unaffordable? Do they not understand that people are struggling to make ends meet and that adding to that tax burden makes things worse, not better?</ParaText><ParaText id="7825848">I can see the looks on the faces of the Liberals. It is not hard to tell what they are thinking as I say this. I know what their questions will be when I finish speaking. They are going to ask me why I did not mention that their government is offering Canadians a carbon tax rebate, and whether I understand that the carbon tax does not really cost anyone any more. If that is the case, why have it at all?</ParaText><ParaText id="7825849">The truth is that the carbon tax is not offset by carbon tax rebates. It is a source of government revenue, just like any other tax. My Liberal friends do not want to admit that they find it better to live in a dream world than admit their taxes are hurting the people they are supposed to serve.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825850">They do not want to hear about the numbers the Parliamentary Budget Officer has given us. They do not want to talk about how their first carbon tax is going to cost the average Canadian family $710 this year after taking their rebate into account. They would prefer that I did not mention that once the second carbon tax is fully implemented, the cost to the average Canadian family after rebates will increase to $1,160 annually.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825851">Let us talk about the true cost of carbon taxes. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the second carbon tax will cost the average Canadian household an extra $573 per year without any rebate, with families in some provinces facing costs as high as $1,157. Both carbon taxes will have a net cost of up to $4,000 for each family depending on the province in which they live. The combined impact of the two Liberal carbon taxes will be an extra 61¢ for every litre of gasoline at the pumps.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825852">If the government was interested in economic growth, it would scrap the new tax and the existing carbon tax. The Parliamentary Budget Officer says the effect of the clean fuel regulations and the existing carbon tax will not help grow the economy but rather will shrink it. That is not what Canadians want from the government's policies.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7825853">I have heard the Liberals' argument. They whine that the Parliamentary Budget officer was not being fair to them and that the PBO only took the numbers into account when making his calculations. The <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">Minister of Environment and Climate Change</Affiliation> has complained that the PBO has not taken into account the technological change the clean fuel regulations will help promote. I would love to hear about those changes from the minister. What new technologies have been developed as a direct result of this tax? My guess is the minister does not understand that taxes do not stimulate invention.</ParaText><ParaText id="7825854">If he wants new technologies, perhaps his government should try to encourage a climate where businesses and individuals are free to innovate. However, do not ask the PBO to calculate the benefits to the economy of some imaginary technology. That makes no sense. Perhaps in some Liberal fantasyland carbon rebates and carbon taxes balance themselves, just as budgets do. In the real world, these taxes hurt Canadians and provide no benefit to the economy or ecology of the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="7825855">Simply put, a tax is a compulsory contribution to state revenue imposed on taxpayers in order to fund government spending. That is what the clean fuel regulations are for. They are to fund government spending. They have nothing to do with combatting climate change. </ParaText><ParaText id="7825856">Unfortunately, the Liberals and their NDP allies appear to be blinded by ideology and uncaring as to the needs of Canadians. It is ludicrous to continually raise taxes at a time of high inflation and when grocery prices are soaring and Canadians are finding it difficult to make ends meet. The government is apparently determined to push through this tax no matter who it hurts. The reality is that the Liberal government's policies are fuelling inflation and making people poorer, which is why one in five Canadians is skipping meals and food banks are seeing record demand. </ParaText><ParaText id="7825857">The Liberals have no plan that will actually help Canada reduce its carbon footprint. The objective is to fund never-ending Liberal deficits. This scheme will only hurt our economy, discourage investment and increase the cost of everything in a Canadian household. </ParaText><ParaText id="7825858">As a Conservative, I oppose this tax and the burden it places on Canadian families. This is not the way to fight climate change. The way to fight climate change is through innovative technologies and harnessing Canadian brainpower, not through increased taxes. A Conservative government will govern with fiscal responsibility, axe these taxes and bring home affordability for Canadians. </ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="173426" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon pricing</Term><Term Id="38425" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="228093" IsProceduralTerm="0">Clean Fuel Regulations</Term><Term Id="38667" IsProceduralTerm="0">Consumer price</Term><Term Id="62794" IsProceduralTerm="0">Cost of living</Term><Term Id="38024" IsProceduralTerm="0">New technologies</Term><Term Id="40241" IsProceduralTerm="1">Opposition motions</Term><Term Id="53694" IsProceduralTerm="0">Petroleum products</Term><Term Id="40957" IsProceduralTerm="1">Splitting speaking time</Term><Term Id="41081" IsProceduralTerm="0">Tax refunds</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12478600" Hour="15" Minute="43"><Person><FirstName>Alexandra</FirstName><LastName>Mendès</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Brossard—Saint-Lambert</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12480057" Hour="15" Minute="52"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12480058" EventId="12253367" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12253367/?ml=en" Sequence="350" Page="15198" PdfPage="58" TypeId="38" Date="2023-06-01" Hour="15" Minute="53" Second="11" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12480058" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Jun%20%201%202023%20%203:53PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12480058"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Business of Supply [Opposition Motion—Carbon Tax]</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12253367"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7825861">Madam Speaker, we believe that we should not impose things on the provinces, as the government is doing to Alberta specifically.

As my Conservative colleagues have reinforced time and time again, legal firearms owners are not criminals. However, Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> treats them this way. This leads me to believe that the bill is not about firearms or assault-style weapons; rather, it is about philosophy and how the government sees the Canadian people. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781667">It seems that the Liberals may be forgetting or perhaps ignoring what it means to have a firearms licence in Canada. Any hunter or sport shooter will proudly tell us about how they underwent a series of background, mental health, common-sense and legislative regulation tests to receive and maintain their licences. They are proud because they have received the trust of society and want to show themselves worthy of that trust. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781668">If the members opposite actually listened to their rural constituents about these issues, they could also explain that, to legally own and register firearms in Canada, they must subject themselves to random check-ins by law enforcement. Moreover, they must report data, such as residency, more often than do most citizens to ensure the safekeeping of their weapons. Before travelling with a firearm, every firearm has specific safety protocols that must be followed. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781669">With this in mind, how would banning the firearms belonging to law-abiding citizens limit the occurrences of violent gun-related crime? How would a crazy repeat offender get a locked-up pistol or hunting rifle from a law-abiding owner? It does not make sense. We cannot deny that violent crime with firearms does happen in Canada. However, they are not mass produced for the Canadian market. People with the technological know-how in the underground market are the real criminals contributing to crime here. People 3-D printing parts of a rifle and mailing them across the international border into Canada are contributing to the illegal underground market; law-abiding firearms owners are not. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781670">The Liberals do not trust Canadians. They see every gun owner as a potential criminal. As far as they are concerned, one gun in private hands is one gun too many. That there is no scientific evidence showing that Canadian farmers, hunters and sport shooters are turning to a life of gun crime is something they choose to ignore. They say that Canada has a gun crime problem and that this will solve it. However, the Liberals are missing the mark and ignoring the evidence. Gun crimes are not being committed by people who purchase their guns legally and then suddenly become lawless. Canada’s gun crime problem has been created by a government that is unwilling to clamp down on the illegal smuggling of weapons into Canada. Shutting down the gun pipeline is hard, but targeting hunters and sports shooters is easy. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781671">This is not to mention the negative impacts that vastly outweigh the positive; I can only imagine how much this ban will negatively impact many Canadians, ranging from those who inherit rifles to citizens whose everyday lives revolve around a culture of hunting and gathering. I cannot help but wonder what rural Canadians will do if this rifle ban passes. Canada is known to be a well-forested country, meaning that we have a fair amount of rural area. The main source of food for many of these Canadians is hunting, and this has been the case for as long as we can remember. With that in mind, how will these hunters eat if the ban goes through? </ParaText><ParaText id="7781672">As seen through the newly proposed passport design, the Liberals’ disregard for the rich Canadian history that preceded us is nothing new. I am not surprised that the Liberal government is living up to its expectation of continued disappointment that Canadians feel toward the government. The more I look at this bill, the more I agree with the member for <Affiliation DbId="278424" Type="2">Kildonan—St. Paul</Affiliation>, who said, “This is the largest assault on hunters in Canadian history.”</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7781673">Rifle owners by inheritance will have to face the sad reality that a part of their family history will be stripped from them at the hands of the government, and hunters will have to face an ever-higher rate of food insecurity in this G7 country. Hunters will have their entire way of life uprooted and have to defer to alternative lifestyles, which they may not have the means to adapt to. This is especially the case considering the cost of inflation and the impact that the carbon tax has had on the cost of living. We cannot tell them to go to a grocery store instead. These rural areas have limited access to the essential services they need, and there is no need to take away a major component of how they can be self-sufficient. It is unjustified.</ParaText><ParaText id="7781674">What happened to the Canadian dream, where hard work gets rewarded and where we are the land of freedom with responsibility? The Liberals have led not just me but many other Canadians to feel that everything is off. Life in Canada is not as free as it used to be eight years ago, and this unjust firearms ban is a symbol of this broken feeling. </ParaText><ParaText id="7781675">Rifles do not harm people; the people behind them do. Instead of attacking the real criminals, the members opposite chose to slap some half-baked idea together and call it a day. This is why I say that the Liberals have missed the mark once again, and it raises the following question: How does this help society?</ParaText><ParaText id="7781676">Does it reduce crime in Canada to take rifles away from hunters with no criminal records? It does not. Does it stop gun crime in our nation to make it impossible for an aspiring biathlete or a target shooter to acquire a rifle? It does not. What it really does is make the Liberals feel good. It allows them to pretend that they are doing something without actually having to take real action.</ParaText><ParaText id="7781677"> When will they finally admit that the legal firearms owners are not the criminals?

Thousands of people have had to flee their homes. The provincial government has declared a state of emergency.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777046">As I mentioned in my S.O. 31 last week, such situations as these remind us that the circumstances people endure may be uncontrollable, but we can definitely control our response to them. Canadians understand the need to work together. I am thankful to those across the country who have travelled to Alberta to assist the firefighting efforts.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777047">One of the biggest strengths of our nation is the willingness of Canadians to come together in a crisis. We support each other because that is the Canadian way of doing things. On behalf of everyone in Alberta, I want to thank those from other provinces and territories for standing up to fight the wildfires.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777048">With the environment on our minds, we turn to consider an environmental bill, Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document>, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. What is the big rush with this bill? Suddenly, the government is in a hurry to pass this legislation; it has come to the point where the government has to limit debate. I find this somewhat amusing. It introduced pretty much the same bill during the last Parliament, but that one failed to pass because the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> thought an early election was more important.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777049">Protecting the environment is something Liberals talk about a lot. We have heard them talking about setting targets for carbon emissions. We do not hear them talk about how the government has never met a target that it set for itself. Talk is easy. Doing something seems to be more difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777050">Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document> is the first major overhaul of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act since the 1990s. Much has changed since then in our understanding of the environment and climate change. The bill is long overdue; however, given the lack of priority the Liberals have given this issue in recent years, I am surprised they feel it is important to limit debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777051">When one looks at the legislation, one cannot help but be disappointed. The bill is not really about environmental protection; it is about updating the rules. There is no doubt that many environmental rules need to be updated. Those on toxic substances come to mind. So much can change in 20 years, but there is nothing new here besides vague and undefined promises. </ParaText><ParaText id="7777052">Many pieces of legislation that have come before this House highlight the stark differences in the visions of Canada put forward by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Conservatives put people first, seeking to make the lives of ordinary Canadians better through sensible financial policies. We understand that the government is not supposed to magically create jobs; rather, it should create an environment where the private sector sees opportunities to create jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777053">This bill recognizes that every Canadian has the right to a healthy environment. It would require the Government of Canada to protect this right, but it would leave it up to the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> to develop an implementation framework and tell us how the right to a healthy environment would be considered in the administration of CEPA.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777054">Several years ago, the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development made recommendations regarding national standards for clean air and clean water. I would have expected them to be included in this legislation. Maybe the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> will get around to including them in the implementation framework, but it would have been nice to have them included so that we could see what the government is planning and make some suggestions for improvement, if needed, in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777055">With all due respect to the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>, I am curious as to what is considered a “healthy environment”. In many ways, the concept goes far beyond the scope of this legislation. Does it include the air we breathe? It most certainly does. What about access to clean drinking water? That goes without saying, although I suppose some communities under drinking water advisories would warn us that such a right has not been extended to all Canadians. Is a healthy environment access to affordable, healthy food? If so, where are the provisions to deal with the inflation the government has created? Yes, the bill would deal with toxic chemicals and with obvious environmental hazards, but there is so much more that needs to be done. I will admit to being a little concerned as to what the minister thinks a healthy environment is, and I hope that, when the definition finally comes, it will be science-based and not sprung out of ideological dogma.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7777056">As I have mentioned here before, the current government has a habit of making pronouncements highlighting its environmental plans, then not following through. I hope that, this time, its members really mean what they say. Certainly, the legislation is long overdue. We know so much more about the environment, climate change and the need for action than we did 20 years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777057">It is certainly time to modernize Canada's chemicals management plan. I would suspect that, given rapid advances in industry, we may want to take another look at the plan in a few years. As a nation, we need to be proactive, making sure the environment is properly protected rather than waiting for an industrial accident that could cause harm to the environment and to the Canadian people. The risk-based approach to chemicals management proposed in Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document> makes sense to me.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777058">Last week, I spoke in this chamber regarding Bill <Document DbId="11675482" Type="3">S-6</Document>, which is an attempt to reduce the mountain of governmental red tape that Canadians face. It seems that, everywhere we turn, there are more regulations. It is almost as if they were breeding.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777059">It is important to have regulations regarding the environment. We need to ensure that our air is fresh and our water pure, not just for today, but for future generations. We hold the environment in trust for our children and grandchildren. Sometimes, though, regulations are unnecessary; they add to the mountain of red tape without achieving what they are supposed to achieve. This is why I am please that Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document> sets out to remove unnecessary red tape from our environmental regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777060">We need protections, but they should be necessary ones. Given the limited scope of the bill, I would not be surprised to see more environmental regulations from the government. Chemicals management and toxic substances are not the only areas of environmental protection that are concerning Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777061">In this House, we are all committed to protecting our environment, although we sometimes differ as to what the best approach would be. Canada remains the envy of the world for our clean water and clean air, as well as the natural beauty of our country. Our responsibility as parliamentarians is to ensure that future generations can enjoy the same healthy environment that we have today. If we can leave our planet and its environment healthier than it was when our parents passed it on to us, then that will be a fitting legacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="7777062">Revisions to our environmental protection laws are long overdue. Perhaps the government has not acted quickly enough, but it is acting. Perhaps the provisions of the bill do not go as far as some would have liked, but the bill is a beginning. It is not the all-encompassing legislation that some would have hoped for. It is a modest beginning that addresses a need. At least it is a start.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="38059" IsProceduralTerm="0">Air quality</Term><Term Id="65356" IsProceduralTerm="0">Chemicals Management Plan</Term><Term Id="39071" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental health</Term><Term Id="39075" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental protection</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="40670" IsProceduralTerm="1">Report stage</Term><Term Id="219975" IsProceduralTerm="0">S-5, An Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, to make related amendments to the Food and Drugs Act and to repeal the Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Virtual Elimination Act</Term><Term Id="40832" IsProceduralTerm="1">Senate bills</Term><Term Id="41330" IsProceduralTerm="0">Water quality</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12432864" Hour="13" Minute="38"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12433584" Hour="13" Minute="47"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12433585" EventId="12214961" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12214961/?ml=en" Sequence="93" Page="14467" PdfPage="21" TypeId="38" Date="2023-05-15" Hour="13" Minute="48" Second="25" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12433585" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%2015%202023%20%201:48PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12433585"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12214961"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7777065">Madam Speaker, I thought the hon. member did not want us to talk about the environment from this side.

Admittedly, English is not my first language, but I was led to understand that “annual” describes something that happens every year. This is the second RMB the current government has offered us. The first was only four years ago. This one was introduced last year, but obviously has not been a priority for the Liberals.

This is just basic common sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="7737270">It includes making changes to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, which would allow the agency to deliver services and allow businesses to interact with CFIA through electronic means rather than having to rely solely on paper-based transactions. This change would reduce administrative burdens for businesses and allow them greater flexibility in their interactions with the government. Paper-based transactions are usually slower than electronic ones. This is also a matter of common sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="7737271">It includes making changes to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act, to enable information sharing to help administer any federal or provincial law for permanent and temporary residents. </ParaText><ParaText id="7737272">This bill has three main purposes: first, to make doing business easier, especially when government is involved; second, to provide flexibility and agility in government regulatory systems; and, third, to improve the integrity of the regulatory system.

It has to start in the roots and it has to be a culture of any government running this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="38344" IsProceduralTerm="0">Bureaucracy</Term><Term Id="38363" IsProceduralTerm="0">Business practice and regulation</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39849" IsProceduralTerm="0">Legislation</Term><Term Id="80585" IsProceduralTerm="0">Modernization</Term><Term Id="219785" IsProceduralTerm="0">S-6, An Act respecting regulatory modernization</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="40832" IsProceduralTerm="1">Senate bills</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12395176" Hour="22" Minute="17"><Person><FirstName>Sébastien</FirstName><LastName>Lemire</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12395178" Hour="22" Minute="19"><Person><FirstName>Stephanie</FirstName><LastName>Kusie</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Calgary Midnapore</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12395123" EventId="12185998" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12185998/?ml=en" Sequence="395" Page="13961" PdfPage="79" TypeId="38" Date="2023-05-03" Hour="22" Minute="19" Second="58" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12395123" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%20%203%202023%2010:19PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12395123"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>An Act Respecting Regulatory Modernization</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12185998"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="15">(2215)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7737279">Madam Speaker, I know so many friends who are trying to start a business or are already in business, and the amount of red tape that they are facing is incredible.</ParaText><ParaText id="7737280">It is so risky nowadays to think about starting a business.

Not only is it grim in the dictionary sense of being depressing or worrying to consider, but it is also Grimm as if it were written by the Grimm brothers. In other words, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has offered us a complete fairy tale. </ParaText><ParaText id="7705953">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> thinks she is playing the role of Snow White, with her cabinet colleagues as the seven dwarfs. Of course, that would leave the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> the role of Prince Charming. However, the Disney version is not the original story. In the Grimm original version of “Snow White”, the one Canadians will experience with this budget, the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> would be the evil queen, and her budget the poisoned apple. Only by removing the apple from Show White's throat can she be saved, and only by defeating this budget can Canada's economy be saved from this Liberal disaster. </ParaText><ParaText id="7705954">Perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has a starring role in another of the Grimm brothers' fairy tales: “Cinderella”. After all, she just bought some new glass slippers before presenting her budget. The minister wants Canadians to believe that she is the fairy godmother, handing out cheques from the government. Who could argue with the idea of free money, even if it causes more inflation? However, the money is not really free. Cinderella may spend, spend and spend, never worrying that the clock is about to strike midnight, but midnight is coming and she will have to face the reality. Her beautiful horses are really mice, and when the clock strikes 12, we will discover just how big a pumpkin she has stuck the Canadian people with.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705955">This type of fairy tale is not a new thing for this government. After eight years, we should be used to the fantasies spun by the Liberal storytellers, by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet. From the beginning, they have shown their inability to understand basic mathematics.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705956">In 2015, the Liberal leader promised Canadians that if he formed government, he would balance the budget by 2019. Does anyone on the other side remember that promise? After eight years, he has not even come close to balancing the budget. Instead, he just piles on more and more debt with government spending that drives up the price of groceries and everything else. He thinks people should be grateful to him for breaking his promises, because his government, as he says, will always have Canadians' backs, which is easy for him to say since we have already had to give him the shirts off our backs to pay for his high prices and high taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705957">The <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has learned from the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. She has not promised us a balanced budget. Given the Liberal track record, I am not sure she knows what a balanced budget is. It may be because there was one thing missing from this budget, one small spending item that would have made a big difference if purchased and used: a dictionary. If the Liberals owned a dictionary, the finance minister might discover that the definition of “fiscal restraint” is not “spend the country into recession”. Fiscal restraint is not telling Canadians in the fall of 2022 that the government expects to run a $30-billion deficit, and then adding an addition $10 billion a few months later. Can the minister be so unaware of the true numbers, or was she intentionally misleading Canadians?</ParaText><ParaText id="7705958">After eight years of this government, the deficits get higher, the national debt grows and our grandchildren will still be stuck with paying for Liberal extravagance. Rather than handing out cheques to Canadians struggling to feed their families due to high grocery prices, why does this government not actually do something about inflation, rather than making things worse? Is it because it does not have a clue how the economy works? </ParaText><ParaText id="7705959">The government can be counted on to always say the right thing, but its actions speak louder than words. Simply put, it does not walk the talk. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7705960">A government that broke its promises about balancing the budget and that has steadily increased the deficit and national debt and fuelled record inflation should not be entrusted with the finances of the nation. Then again, the Liberals spent $6,000 a night on a hotel room for the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, complete with butler service. Perhaps the Liberals do understand the financial challenges faced by ordinary Canadians and instead just do not care.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705961">I am not the only one who has noticed that the budget presented to us by the <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is a fairy tale. According to The Globe and Mail, this budget “is all a fiscal fantasy: the Liberal budget is built on a cloud of sleight-of-hand projections and the hope that Canadians are suffering from collective amnesia.” If <Affiliation DbId="263831" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> Cinderella really wants to help Canadians, and I believe she does, she needs to abandon this reckless spending program that she described as “fiscal restraint”. She needs to recognize that people are suffering and she can act to make things better. </ParaText><ParaText id="7705962">First, she needs to lower taxes and scrap the carbon tax so that hard work will pay off again. The grocery tax rebate she is offering does not make up for the increases in payroll taxes and the carbon tax. Her policies are fuelling inflation and making people poorer, which is why one in five Canadians is skipping meals and food banks are seeing record demand. Second, she needs to get government spending under control. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has added more to our national debt than all prime ministers in our history.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705963">The finance minister says that she will balance the budget in 2028, but she has no plan. Continued inflationary deficits are driving up the cost of the goods we buy and the interest we pay. The finance minister's plan to balance the budget is probably the same one her predecessor used: keep on spending with even greater deficits and pretend that the budget will somehow magically balance itself in a few years. After all, we are living in a Liberal fairy tale where such things can happen, except they do not happen. As the government has never managed to meet a self-imposed climate change target, so too has it continuously failed to show any signs of fiscal restraint or fiscal responsibility. It is as if the minister knows the government is doomed so she does not have to worry about it or about balancing the budget. Instead, eliminating the national debt will be someone else's problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="7705964">When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was staying in that $6,000-a-night hotel suite, he went down to the hotel lobby one evening for a sing-along.

Canada does not take unilateral military action against aggressive regimes.

This legislation attempts to address that suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655139">For example, Canada does not recognize the legality of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, as the Taliban is a terrorist entity. We have no relations with it. We do not support terrorists. However, the people of Afghanistan are in need and their terrorist government has no desire to help them. Drastic changes are needed in states like Afghanistan, but more war is not the answer. This bill is a sign that Canada recognizes that. As we deal with the reality of the situation in Afghanistan and elsewhere, this bill would allow us to assist the critical organizations involved in providing immediate aid to those people most in need.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655140">Our role as parliamentarians should be to have a free and open debate about the specifics of Bill <Document DbId="12265330" Type="3">C-41</Document>, which includes conducting an adequate study in committee.

By doing so, we would allow a thorough study of this act and provide interested Canadians the opportunity to debate and understand the specific details of what Bill C-41 has to offer.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655141">Canadians do not want to endorse non-democratic states. However, the on-the-ground support offered through various activist-led operations should not be hindered due to the oppressive cultural and political climate entrenched in these states. We need to promote “Women, Life, Freedom” in these areas. Real changes have to start somewhere. This bill has the potential to provide a beacon of hope to those in dire need of humanitarian aid. There is also the potential to leave a distasteful legacy if we in this House fail to launch a swift and adequate study of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655142">It is important to the Canadian people that we stick to our true democratic values. Because of this, upholding the legacy of honourable success stories should be of utmost importance. The Canadian war efforts from 2001 and 2014 in Afghanistan highlighted the tragic failure of democracy against a terrorist stronghold. Since the reoccupation by the Taliban in 2021, it has been made abundantly clear that our approach was not effective in creating lasting change. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655143">Our Canadian troops heard first-hand the stories of Afghan citizens of repression under the Taliban. They not only fought for their Canada, but they also fought for the good, innocent people they grew to love in their day-to-day lives. The grim situations they observed first-hand in Afghanistan should be enough for us to see that this bill, which would allow aid groups to meet the needs of the desperate without fear of criminal charges, should be supported. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7655144">One of my staffers, whose mother served with our troops in Afghanistan, has recounted the stories her mother shared of her time serving there protecting the people from the Taliban. As she struggled to reintegrate into the Canadian way of life upon returning, she found herself facing deep grief and inner turmoil as the Taliban once again seized power 13 years after she had physically left the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655145">My colleagues, that mother's experience is not hers alone. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655146">Canadian troops put their lives on the line not only for their country, but to help Afghan women and children have hope of a better life. Years of conflict and violence led to a humanitarian crisis that shattered the innocence of these people. Many were left with the impression that dangerous and unethical acts are how one earns the love desired from one's parents. Their sense of purpose in life is determined by the warped world view of the Taliban.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655147">No child should have to grow up in fear, but that is the situation in Afghanistan. While we cannot do anything at this point about the government that creates that fear, with Bill <Document DbId="12265330" Type="3">C-41</Document> we can probably do something to help with the humanitarian crisis the Taliban has created. We owe it to our veterans and to our fallen soldiers to continue the effort toward a better humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. We cannot let their sacrifices be in vain.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655148">Bill <Document DbId="12265330" Type="3">C-41</Document> would allow us, as Canadians, to help the immediate situation on the ground while other work is being done behind the scenes to influence the meaningful societal shift required.</ParaText><ParaText id="7655149">With that in mind, I believe approaching the situation from both the top down and the bottom up should be the most effective way of inciting the change we seek. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655150">This bill provides the foundation that assists on-the-ground organizations to operate in terrorist-run states. However, we must tread carefully. Bill <Document DbId="12265330" Type="3">C-41</Document> still needs work. The people of Afghanistan, and others, still need help. We must ensure this bill is swiftly examined and improvements adopted. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655151">We might, for example, want to look at our duty to protect Canadians who become targets of oppression in states like Afghanistan. Citizens who courageously go to these states to provide humanitarian aid to the suffering victims of these states know the Government of Canada will support them in any way it can. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655152">Many questions will arise as this bill progresses through this House and we should allow some time to address the concerns of our colleagues in a thorough but timely fashion. A prestudy by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights would assist in this goal. </ParaText><ParaText id="7655153">To be quite honest, the real question is whether Liberal government members are serious about providing protection for aid organizations and will make it a priority or whether it will be consigned to the legislative back burner as not important. Human lives are at stake.

More than 55,000 Canadians died COVID-related deaths. That is a sobering statistic. This number is more than die each year of heart disease and about four times the number of people who die accidentally each year. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622545">We do not remember statistics though. We remember husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, and grandparents whose lives were shortened by the disease. Each one was an individual. Each one was loved. Behind each death, there is an intensely personal story. Their loved ones remember them every day. They do not need the government to set aside a designated day for that purpose. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622546">Do we need a pandemic observance day to give the Canadian public an opportunity to commemorate the efforts to get through the pandemic? Communities came together in innovative ways to deal with a situation no one had prepared for. It can be inspiring to think of the ways individual Canadians reached out to others for the benefit of all. It can be said that Canadians showed their resilience in the way they supported each other through that very trying period. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622547">The COVID-19 pandemic brought the Canadian people together. It was a shared experience that brought out the best in people. It also brought out the worst of the government's performance. The most memorable stories of the COVID-19 pandemic are not those of individuals coming together but of a government out of control, out of touch with reality and showing itself to be incompetent, corrupt or maybe both. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622548">As the pandemic was unfolding, the government sent 16 tonnes of badly needed personal protective equipment to another country: 50,118 face shields, 1,101 masks, 1,820 pairs of goggles, 36,425 medical coveralls, 200,000 nitrile gloves and 3,000 aprons. In doing so, it left our country without sufficient supplies for our own medical personnel. Canada was unprepared for the pandemic. The government failed in its duty to protect the Canadian people. It apparently believed the virus was not going to come here. It kept that attitude despite the fact that it had been warned. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622549">In 2004, the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health presented its recommendations to the government. Canada was unprepared for the SARS outbreak, it said, “because too many earlier lessons were ignored.”</ParaText><ParaText id="7622550">SARS made hundreds of Canadians sick and killed 44. It paralyzed a major segment of Ontario's health care system for weeks, and thousands were placed in quarantine. Overworked health care workers felt mental and emotional stress. Does that not sound just like the COVID-19 pandemic? </ParaText><ParaText id="7622551">It was sadly obvious that the Liberals were unprepared for COVID-19. If they had paid attention to the SARS report, they would not have been giving away the very materials our health care system needed. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622552">Given the Liberal track record, Canadians have no reason to believe the government will, as this bill suggests, spend any time reflecting on ways to prepare for any future pandemics, unless it is reflecting on finding ways to enrich its friends during a time of crisis. This will happen at the taxpayers’ expense, of course. </ParaText><ParaText id="7622553">As unprepared as they were, the Liberals did see some opportunities as COVID-19 cases mounted in Canada. This is something all Canadians should remember. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7622554">We can think back to March 2020, as the first COVID cases were being reported in Canada. After giving away the PPE equipment our health care workers needed to fight the pandemic, the Liberals decided that they needed sweeping new powers to tax and spend without parliamentary scrutiny. When that did not work, they shut down Parliament to avoid being held accountable.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622555">Faced with a global health emergency, their first response was an attack on democracy. They did not want Canadians to be informed of what was going on. They did not want to have to answer questions in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622556">They hoped no one would notice when an organization with financial ties to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>’s and finance minister’s families were chosen to receive millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money through sole-sourced contracts.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622557">The public service has considerable expertise and experience in administering government programs. Instead, the Liberals tried to funnel the money to their friends. When the wrongdoing by the former minister of finance was discovered, at least he was honourable enough to resign, unlike the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has apparently never done anything wrong in his life.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622558">Apparently, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has not even read the Ethics Commissioner’s reports, which is perhaps not surprising. The pandemic has shown that the Liberals are, at best, ethically challenged. They do not understand the rules, even simple ones, such as that we do not give government contracts to our friends.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622559">After the Ethics Commissioner found that the <Affiliation DbId="278924" Type="4">Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development</Affiliation> had broken the rules, she apologized. However, she has not offered to repay the money that she had her department give to her friend.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622560">There was also the former Liberal MP whose medical supply company was awarded a $237-million contract for 8,000 ventilators, at $10,000 more each than what is paid in the U.S.A. Once again, a contract was awarded without competitive bidding, this time to a company that had never made ventilators before.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622561">The government spent $1.1 billion for 40,000 ventilators. Most of them were not needed because COVID was not as bad as forecasted, and now they are just gathering dust in warehouses.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622562">When Canadians remember the pandemic, they will remember the Liberals investing $130 million of taxpayers' money in a vaccine that was being developed by a Canadian firm partially owned by a tobacco company. Was there no one smart enough to ask whether such a vaccine would be acceptable to the World Health Organization? Apparently there was not. It was no surprise to anyone, except perhaps the Liberal government, when the WHO failed to approve the vaccine because of the tobacco company involvement.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622563">Canadians do not need a special pandemic observance day to remember the most out-of-control government spending. There was billions of dollars in handouts, no accountability and no determination as to whether the funds were really needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622564">Canadians will have no choice but to remember the biggest government spending spree in our history because they will be paying off the debt for decades. My unborn grandchildren will be paying off the Liberals' debt. They will wish they had nothing to remember.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622565">Canadians remember the incompetence of the government as the pandemic became endemic. As travel became possible once more, those lucky enough to get a passport endured chaos at the airports. The Liberal government could not even figure out how to make the system work.</ParaText><ParaText id="7622566">Inflation rose to record levels, and the government responded by tripling its carbon tax instead of providing relief for Canadians struggling to make ends meet. Canadians will remember that every day; no special day is required. Canadians do not need a pandemic observance day to remember their loved ones, nor do they need this legislation to remember just how incompetent and corrupt the Liberal government was in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="208127" IsProceduralTerm="0">Biomanufacturing</Term><Term Id="38649" IsProceduralTerm="0">Conflict of interest</Term><Term Id="200792" IsProceduralTerm="0">COVID-19</Term><Term Id="38802" IsProceduralTerm="0">Deaths and funerals</Term><Term Id="39088" IsProceduralTerm="0">Ethics and ethical issues</Term><Term Id="39387" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government expenditures</Term><Term Id="57744" IsProceduralTerm="0">Immunization</Term><Term Id="177231" IsProceduralTerm="0">Medicago Inc.</Term><Term Id="40056" IsProceduralTerm="0">Mortality rates</Term><Term Id="40278" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pandemic</Term><Term Id="218395" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pandemic Observance Day</Term><Term Id="201751" IsProceduralTerm="0">Personal protective equipment</Term><Term Id="101923" IsProceduralTerm="0">Philip Morris International</Term><Term Id="40497" IsProceduralTerm="1">Private Members' Bills</Term><Term Id="218386" IsProceduralTerm="0">S-209, An Act respecting Pandemic Observance Day</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="40832" IsProceduralTerm="1">Senate bills</Term><Term Id="40843" IsProceduralTerm="0">Severe acute respiratory syndrome</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12272240" Hour="18" Minute="22"><Person><FirstName>Carol</FirstName><LastName>Hughes</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12272163" Hour="18" Minute="32"><Person><FirstName>Luc</FirstName><LastName>Thériault</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Montcalm</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="12268709" Title="Hansard - 165" TypeId="37" Date="2023-03-07" Time="10:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/165/HAN165-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="12266623" EventId="12081648" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12081648/?ml=en" Sequence="61" Page="12023" PdfPage="15" TypeId="38" Date="2023-03-07" Hour="11" Minute="22" Second="58" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12266623" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Mar%20%207%202023%2011:22AM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12266623"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="12081648"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7621156">Madam Speaker, last week, the federal government banned the use of the TikTok app on government devices because of data privacy concerns, so it is very appropriate for us to be discussing this matter today. Digital data privacy can be seen as a fundamental right, one that urgently requires strengthened legislation, protections and enforcement. Canadians must have the right to access and control the collection, use, monitoring, retention and disclosure of their personal data.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621157">This is a pressing issue. Realizing that, the European Union introduced the GDPR, its General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016. EU countries were given a couple of years to adapt to this new privacy reality, with the regulation coming into effect in 2018. The GDPR has been used by many other countries as a framework for privacy protection. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621158">With the GDPR as an example, and faced with a changing digital data universe, the government basically did nothing to protect data privacy for Canadians. Perhaps that is an unfair statement. After all, digital and online data privacy was addressed in the last Parliament under Bill <Document DbId="10950130" Type="3">C-11</Document>. The Liberals recognized that Canada needed to bring its privacy laws into the 21st century. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621159">However, that bill was never passed. Apparently, data privacy was not a big enough issue to be made a priority, and the digital charter implementation act was scrapped in favour of an election that Canadians neither wanted nor needed. Now we are asked once again to address this subject. It is indeed better late than never. I would have hoped, though, that with the delay, the government could have improved on what it is proposing.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621160">Perhaps if the government had moved a little faster, Canadians would not have had to question how their data was being used and how their privacy was being invaded by governments and corporations. We are left to wonder how many privacy breaches have gone undetected or unreported. The ones we know of are disturbing enough. Tim Hortons used its app to track customer movements. The RCMP used Clearview AI’s illegally created facial recognition database.

With technological changes in recent years, legislation is needed to address subjects such as biometrics and artificial intelligence. We have to consider how Canadians understand the issue of consent when it comes to the use of their data and their privacy. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621162">I am deeply concerned and disappointed with how sloppy the Liberal approach in Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, the digital charter implementation act, 2022, currently is. Privacy is a fundamental right. This bill does not mention that, despite the Supreme Court of Canada having acknowledged it. We need to clearly distinguish the extent to which Canadians’ digital privacy will be protected. If the government wants the bill to be fully effective, it needs to further explore the scope of accountability required when privacy is breached. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621163">The clear definition of consent is a major improvement from what it once was in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act, but a good definition is only the beginning. Because technology has greatly expanded and evolved since the implementation of PIPEDA, should we not also expand the umbrella of activities that consent would cover? The large number of exemptions allowed would weaken the impact of the legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621164">Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> may be a good beginning, but I had hoped for something better. It is sad that the bill’s title is perhaps the strongest statement in the legislation. While the title gives some idea of what the legislation is all about, it is already dated. We are no longer in 2022, and the Liberals are once again falling behind. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621165">As parliamentarians, we know the power of words and the importance of speaking in a way that can be understood by those receiving the message. It is important that legislation can be understood. It is even more crucial that the bills we pass spell out exactly what we intend.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621166"> Perhaps the most important part of any of the laws is the section that provides definitions. They need to be clear and comprehensible and not subject to differing interpretations that weaken the intent of the legislation. Legislation that allows each person to provide their own definitions is problematic. Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document> uses words such as “significant impact” or “sensitive information”. I cannot help but question what is covered by these vague terms. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621167">Before the people of Edmonton Manning sent me to represent them in the House, I was a businessman. I understood the importance of safeguarding the personal information my customers entrusted to me and not to abuse that trust. However, as we have seen, some companies make unauthorized use of the information they gather to gain a competitive edge or for profit.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621168"> With that in mind, there must be a balance between acceptable use of data by business and the fundamental protection of our privacy. It seems to me that the balance is wrong on this bill, given the way it addresses user consent and the use of collected information. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621169">The more I read Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which 100 pages-plus, the more questions I have. There is too much in it in need of clarification. Yes, that will be done when it goes to committee after second reading, but the government could have presented a better bill to make the committee’s work easier.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621170"> I do not want to sound too negative. I know the Liberals mean well, even if they do not seem to be able to quite understand just how important digital privacy is to Canadians in the 21st century. I am pleased therefore to see that they understand that sometimes mere words or a scolding are not enough. </ParaText><ParaText id="7621171">It makes sense to me that the Privacy Commissioner will receive new powers to enforce violations of the consumer privacy protection act. That may be the most impactful change the legislation brings about. It is not enough to simply recommend that perpetrators stop their violations. Any parent could tell us that consequences are needed if we want to ensure improved behaviour. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7621172">With the Privacy Commissioner finally being able to force violators to conform to the rules, I think we will see increased respect and better treatment of Canadians' personal information. The harsh financial penalties for non-compliance will be a powerful motivator.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621173"> Given the amount of time the Liberals had before presenting Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C-27</Document>, we must question why they did not come up with a better bill. They have left me, and all Canadians, asking if they really understand what their own legislation is supposed to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="7621174"> Does the consumer privacy protection act, as proposed in the bill, do enough to properly protect Canadians’ personal information? The Liberals had a chance to look at the EU’s GDPR and see how well that worked.

No wonder Canada has become the destination of choice for Arabs seeking a better life.</ParaText><ParaText id="7589649">The lack of freedoms in some places in the Arab world is perhaps one of the reasons why we need an Arab heritage month. Canadians need to be reminded that there is so much more to the history and culture of the Arab people than the negative portrayals found all too often in the news. The current political activities in the region do not always reflect the values of the Arab people, just as the actions of the Government of Canada do not always reflect the values of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7589650">Arab heritage month would be an opportunity for those of us of with Arab roots to share the richness of our culture in a more deliberate way than is the case now.

Naturally I feel the Arabic language films are best heard in the original, as Arabic is one of the most beautiful languages in the world. I would encourage all hon. members to learn my mother tongue, but watching with subtitles can still convey the cultural richness of the Arab world.</ParaText><ParaText id="7589652">It is not just in film that there is a long-standing tradition, but in music also. Just last month I watched Christa Maria Abou Akl, who was born, as I was, in Lebanon, appear on the French language television show <I>La Voix</I>, which airs on the TVA network, singing in Arabic and French. Just 20 years old, Christa Maria is already a musical force to be reckoned with. It was my privilege to get to know the family four years ago when they first arrived in Montreal. It was a pleasure to see Christa's success in becoming part of our music future and history in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="7589653">I am proud of my heritage and am happy to see the establishment of Arab heritage month.

What was once unthinkable is now being promoted as normal, which may explain why, in October of last year, a representative of the Quebec college of physicians suggested that MAID be extended to infants under the age of one with serious health conditions. These children are obviously too young to make such a decision themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574968">It was somewhat reassuring to hear the <Affiliation DbId="278928" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion</Affiliation> say that she was shocked by the suggestion and found it unacceptable.

That, to put it mildly, is a significant number. Furthermore, by the time Canadians reach 40 years of age, one in two, which is half the population, have or have had a mental illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574970">We need to recognize what that means for our country. Mental illness is a serious problem, but addressing it by making assisted suicide an option is not the way to proceed.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574971">Speaking to the CBC, the minister of disability said that she frequently hears that some people with disabilities are seeking assisted death because they cannot find adequate housing or sufficient care, that they are choosing death because of a lack of social supports.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7574972">Is that not also the case for those suffering from mental illness? The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health tells us that about 4,000 Canadians commit suicide each year, an average of almost 11 a day, people of all ages and backgrounds. Those numbers are sobering. </ParaText><ParaText id="7574973">In Ontario, 4% of adults and 14% of high school students report having seriously contemplated suicide in the past year. More than 75% of suicides involve men, but women attempt suicide three to four times more often. More than half of suicides involve people aged 45 or older.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574974">In Alberta, each year, according to the University of Alberta, one in six people will seriously think about suicide. There are an average of 2,400 hospital stays and more than 6,000 emergency room visits annually for self-inflicted injuries, the result of suicide attempts. More than 500 Albertans will die by suicide each year. According to Alberta Health Services, in 2018, 7,254 Albertans visited the emergency department for suicide attempts. Three out of four suicide deaths are male, about 50% being middle-aged men aged 40 to 64.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574975"> After accidents, suicide is the second leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 24. Indigenous people, especially youth, die by suicide at rates much higher than non-indigenous people. First nations youth aged 15 to 24 die by suicide about six times more often than non-indigenous youth. Suicide rates for Inuit youth are about 24 times the national average. This is a national tragedy.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574976">Experts tell us that mental and physical health are linked, which means that people with long-term physical health conditions such as chronic pain are much more likely to also experience mood disorders. In the same way, people suffering from mood disorders are at much higher risk of developing a long-term medical condition. </ParaText><ParaText id="7574977">What does it say about Canada as a society and Canadians as people that our response to mental illness is now going to be focusing on killing people rather than appropriate medical treatment? If we were doing a better job of supporting those who are mentally ill, we might not be having this discussion today.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574978">Many of those suffering from mental illness in its various forms will tell us that there are good days and bad days. On the bad days, when the dark cloud descends and it feels like it will never lift, death seems a pleasant option, but for most people, it does lift. As I said earlier, about half the population will experience some form of mental illness at some point in their lives. For most, it is something they can overcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574979">Making suicide easier by calling it “medical assistance in dying” will, I am certain, mean that people with treatable mental illness will choose death. Some may do so because they are having a low period and do not see any hope for the future. For others, it may be a lack of medical and social support to help them deal with their illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574980">Mental illness in Canada is estimated to cost about $50 billion annually when we include health care costs, loss of productivity and a reduction in health-related quality of life. That cost could be reduced if we were to invest more in mental health promotion and illness prevention programs, more support for early intervention aimed at children and families, and more emphasis on treatment for depression and anxiety disorders.</ParaText><ParaText id="7574981">We need to pass this legislation, because there is a deadline approaching.

This motion is in the same spirit as that one.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546373">It is no surprise that the Chinese government, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, denies what is taking place.

Perhaps there are logistical questions in moving thousands of people from the other side of the world to Canada, but if there is a will, logistics can be overcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546381">However, we need to remember there is more to this equation than geography and seeing how many people can fit into a particular space. We are not talking about numbers here.

A new life in Canada can offer hope, hope for a new life in a peaceful land where they will not suffer for their ethnicity or their religion.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546383">I know, first-hand, that it is possible, for I have experienced Canada as a welcoming place, but should it be the first choice? Has anyone thought to ask those fleeing the genocide if coming to Canada is their first choice or their second or their third? Maybe starting fresh in Canada seems more appealing than life in refugee camps, but do they know the reality of what life looks like in Canada? I applaud the spirit of this motion, but I wonder if we have explored all options.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546384">Would these refugees be happier if a way could be found for them to be integrated into community life in the countries where they have taken refuge, rather than travelling across the world to a place with an unfamiliar language and culture? Could Canada help with that?</ParaText><ParaText id="7546385">The government is not very good at hands-on compassion. Ask any recently arrived immigrant. Many who come here find that Canada is not that promised land after all. The truth is that people fleeing conflict zones and attempted genocide need more than just a roof over their heads and a few language lessons. They need to know that they are safe and accepted, that there are people in this new land who are very happy to see them, who want to be their friends and who value them for who they are.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546386">Government programs, no matter how well-meaning, cannot replace the personal touch. Those fleeing genocide, and indeed all newcomers to Canada, need someone who can help with the basics. For some, that would be a family member who has come here before them, but for most of those fleeing conflict, such as the Uighurs, it would be a Canadian reaching out in friendship to a newcomer.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546387">That is what we did with the boat people coming from Vietnam in the early 1980s. That is what we have been doing with those refugees who came from Syria seven years ago, and those who continue to arrive on our shores today. We, here, can say, “Let us bring in these people who need our help”, but it is the Canadian people who will make these newcomers feel welcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546388">Conservatives believe that Canada's immigration system should uphold Canada's humanitarian tradition of providing safe haven for refugees. I think that may be something that all political parties can agree on.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546389">There may be some who are concerned about the reaction from the government of the People's Republic of China, which has been trying to have the countries where the Uighurs have taken refuge return the refugees, in violation of international law.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546390">I would not be surprised if the Chinese ambassador to Canada calls me to complain about the words I have chosen to use today. His government insists that there is no genocide and feels insulted when people talk about it. I would invite the ambassador to take a trip with me to the border areas of the neighbouring countries where the Uighurs have fled. I would invite him to talk with the refugees, to hear their stories, and then I would ask him again if there is no genocide.</ParaText><ParaText id="7546391">I doubt I will have that opportunity, but we in this House do have the opportunity to show our support for the Uighur people.

Each box had a window showing the top half of the front page if it was a broadsheet and the whole page if it was a tabloid. If one wanted to read anything more, one had to put a quarter in the box and remove a copy of the paper. In our cities, it was common to find three or four such boxes for competing newspapers on the same corners of the downtown of any city. Those newspaper boxes are, for the most part, long gone as the nature of the news business has changed. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514339">Home delivery, one of the mainstays of the newspaper industry, has declined drastically. These days, most people get their news online. The news industry has changed in how news is gathered and changed in how it is delivered to consumers. Gone are the days where most people subscribe to home delivery for the morning and the afternoon. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514340">For those in the news media, the challenge has always been to provide a public service while ensuring sufficient revenue to continue their function. Canadian journalists and publishers have always risen to that challenge. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514341">This is not the first time technology has upended the news industry. As television became popular in the 1950s, many feared the end of print publication or journalism. Newspapers survived the challenge posed by this new medium by concentrating on in-depth reporting, which television, with its constraints, could not do. Quality journalism was still possible back then.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514342">One could say that Google and other search engines function today as the newspapers did in the 1970s. They show the headlines but not the whole story. They provide a link for people to click on. Facebook, the other online giant the Liberals seem to be most concerned about, does the same thing. Providing a link that allows people to access and use websites could be considered by some to be a public service or an aid to the news industry. If people want to read the full article, they have to follow the rules set by the news organizations that publish it. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514343">In the early days of the Internet, many news organizations placed their material online free for anyone who wanted to read it. Most of those now allow limited access to non-subscribers. In some ways, one could argue that the news industry should be paying the tech companies for attracting readers to their articles or their content. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514344">Facebook and Google sell advertising on their websites and have lots of advertisements. Perhaps some of that might have gone to other media in the past. Given the way the Liberals think, it is possible and only natural that the government wants to intervene in what would be a private commercial industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514345">Canada's Conservatives believe that the Canadian news media should be fairly compensated for the use of its content by platforms like Google and Facebook. The issue here is how that should happen and what should be the role of government, if any, in the process. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514346">Media companies could inform Google and Facebook that linking to their news sites is no longer allowed and that breaking that rule without permission would be a copyright violation. Media companies deserve compensation for their work, and some have negotiated agreements with the tech companies for the online use of their content, which has me wondering why government feels the need to intervene.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514347">The government, which has in the past shown its willingness to give taxpayer dollars to the news industry, does not seem to understand the difference between public and private. One would think that a billion dollars a year to the CBC would be enough to exempt it from receiving more money under the bill, but it is not. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514348">This is flawed legislation. It seems as if this government has taken a worthy idea, which ensures that Canada has a healthy, free and vibrant press, and brought in a bill for which the ramifications have not been considered.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7514349">Why is the CRTC being given oversight? Despite what some Liberals may think, the Internet is not broadcasting. Print media are definitely not broadcasters. Where is the logic in asking the CRTC to oversee something when it neither has the expertise or the resources to do so? Is this all about building a new bureaucracy? Indeed it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514350">The online news act is supposed to protect the struggling Canadian news industry. How could anyone disagree with such a noble purpose? Would this bill solve any problems, or would it create new ones? How would fair compensation be determined? Who would be compensated under this act and who would be excluded? Why should a government agency be making such determinations?</ParaText><ParaText id="7514351">The tech giants have widened the reach of Canada's news organizations by bringing their materials to the attention of the people who might not otherwise know of them. I am sure this increased audience has been beneficial to all sides. Mechanisms already exist through which media can be compensated by those using their materials. We have a Copyright Act. Some companies have come to an agreement with the tech giants, so why is more government needed?</ParaText><ParaText id="7514352">There is no need for this bill, except that the Liberals love to meddle in things that do not concern them at all. What other areas does the government wish to shove itself into rather than letting companies work out their own agreements?</ParaText><ParaText id="7514353">If these technology companies feel there is value in linking to Canadian news organizations, why can they not negotiate contracts without government interference? If Canadians are turning to these tech companies for news, then the companies need to find a way to provide content. Short of starting their own news organizations, which strikes me as an unlikely possibility, they have to turn to existing news organizations. If they find value there, they will pay for it. It is very simple.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514354">This bill defines a news outlet as “an undertaking or any distinct part of an undertaking, such as a section of a newspaper, the primary purpose of which is to produce news content”. It is a very nice definition. Those words, however, do not reflect reality. This is a dispute about money, pure and simple.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514355"> Producing news content may be the goal of those in the newsroom, those seeking to produce quality journalism for the public good. It may even be why a given publication was first founded, but is not the reason for its existence. The reality is that news outlets, like the big tech companies, exist to make money. This bill is about who gets the biggest slice of the advertising pie, pure and simple.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514356"> If news organizations perform a service by keeping the public informed about important issues, that is, in many ways, only a by-product of the business. Those running news organizations are rarely, if ever, journalists themselves. If news organizations thought they could make as much or more money by publishing only chocolate cake recipes, they would do so. Let us not delude ourselves into thinking otherwise.</ParaText><ParaText id="7514357">Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document> is flawed and probably unnecessary legislation, which puts it in line with the rest of the current government's legislative agenda.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="217068" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-18, An Act respecting online communications platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada</Term><Term Id="802" IsProceduralTerm="0">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</Term><Term Id="58225" IsProceduralTerm="0">Digital media</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="78902" IsProceduralTerm="0">News services</Term><Term Id="40149" IsProceduralTerm="0">Newspapers</Term><Term Id="40646" IsProceduralTerm="0">Regulation</Term><Term Id="69081" IsProceduralTerm="0">Subscriptions</Term><Term Id="54871" IsProceduralTerm="1">Third reading and adoption</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12163632" Hour="16" Minute="03"><Person><FirstName>Alexandra</FirstName><LastName>Mendès</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Brossard—Saint-Lambert</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12163184" Hour="16" Minute="13"><Person><FirstName>Lisa</FirstName><LastName>Hepfner</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Hamilton Mountain</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12163186" EventId="12001797" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/12001797/?ml=en" Sequence="325" Page="10838" PdfPage="64" TypeId="38" Date="2022-12-13" Hour="16" Minute="15" Second="16" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12163186" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Dec%2013%202022%20%204:15PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12163186"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Online News Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="12001797"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7514363">Madam Speaker, I thank the member for being such a good Edmontonian and congratulate her for coming this way. </ParaText><ParaText id="7514364">She mentioned the change in the landscape in advertising and of newspapers.

So much of our lives is stored on our personal devices, protected by passwords and multi-factor authentication in the hopes of keeping our most private information secure.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473836">Corporations are increasingly at risk. It seems as if every day we hear a new report of companies’ computer systems being hacked and their data held for ransom by thieves who have managed digital anonymity. Law enforcement officials say many such cybercrimes go unreported, with companies paying quietly and privately so as to avoid publicity.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473837"> Our public institutions are not immune either. Hospitals have had their computer systems attacked by intruders, putting patients' lives at risk. Emergency services have been attacked, as have the parliamentary computer systems. </ParaText><ParaText id="7473838">Cyber-threats remain a national security and economic issue that threatens the safety and security of Canadians. Government and industry alike have highlighted the need for regulation in cybersecurity. There has been a lot of talk, but not much else.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473839"> Currently the Canadian government does not have a legal mechanism to compel action to address cyber-threats or vulnerabilities in the telecommunications sector, yet cybersecurity has become one of the primary issues each person and institution has to address. I am pleased that the government has introduced this legislation to allow us in the House to examine the cybersecurity concerns and needs of our nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473840">Bill <Document DbId="11862853" Type="3">C-26</Document> would amend the Telecommunications Act as well as other related acts. The intention would be to amend the Telecommunications Act to add the promotion of the security of the Canadian telecommunications system as an objective of Canadian telecommunications policy and to authorize the Governor in Council and the Minister of Industry to direct telecommunications service providers to do anything, or refrain from doing anything that is necessary to secure the Canadian telecommunications system.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473841">I do not think there is anyone in the House, indeed in the country, who would disagree with the objective. As I have already pointed out, there is a problem with cybersecurity in our society, and government has an important role to play in protecting Canadian individuals and institutions. Some may wonder about giving such power to the Governor in Council and the Minister of Industry, but there are rules for the judicial review of those orders and applications. This is not a granting of absolute power, but of limited power subject to the checks and balances needed in a democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473842">The bill would also enact the critical cyber systems protection act to provide a framework for the protection of the cyber systems of services and systems vital to national security or public safety. This, among other things, would authorize the Governor in Council to designate any service or system as a vital service or vital system. It would require designated operators to establish and implement cybersecurity programs, mitigate supply chain and third party risks, report cybersecurity incidents and comply with cybersecurity directions.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473843">One would think that such cybersecurity measures should be common sense and not need to be mandated by government. Is it right to compel private corporations and organizations to use their own resources to invest in cybersecurity? It would seem to me that well-run businesses would put cybersecurity first. Not every aspect of a business generates income, and smart business managers and owners know that. As the cliché goes, they have to spend money to make money.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473844"> Implementing cybersecurity measures comes with a cost. There is no doubt about that. It would seem to me, though, that the cost would be considerably less than the cost of dealing with criminals holding their data for ransom after they have invaded their computer system and locked them out of it. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7473845">Cybersecurity makes common sense for business. However, given that implementing cybersecurity measures comes with a financial cost with no corresponding revenue, do we really want to rely on those who might put short-term profits first, or does it make more sense in this case for government to step in to save some business owners from themselves? </ParaText><ParaText id="7473846">As someone who has spent most of his life working as a businessman, I am reluctant to suggest that business owners need to be saved from themselves, but as a Canadian I know that sometimes such action is necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473847">We have only to look at the history of one of Canada's most successful companies: Nortel. It is a company that might still exist if those running it had taken cybersecurity more seriously. With more than 94,000 employees worldwide, Nortel was a high-tech leader until its headquarters were bugged, its computer systems breached and its intellectual property stolen. Now it is just a memory. We will never know for sure, but perhaps if cybersecurity had been a higher priority at Nortel, it would still be providing jobs, products and services for Canadian people. If anyone ever asks why we would take cybersecurity seriously, the one-word answer is “Nortel”.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473848">Though I am a little uneasy that this bill would almost certainly increase regulations and red tape, maybe there are ways that some of the excessive paperwork that seems to be beloved by the Liberals can be made reasonable. Certainly there is a need to ensure a level playing field of regulatory burdens for small and medium-sized businesses and organizations. If there is not, then I can see companies being forced into bankruptcy by the cost of implementing government-mandated cybersecurity procedures. I know that is not the government's intention, but as we have seen in the past, sometimes not all the impacts of government rule-making are foreseen. The <Affiliation DbId="271243" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> especially needs to ensure that the rules are workable and provide protection against attacks by criminals and malicious states.</ParaText><ParaText id="7473849">Indeed, it is perhaps malicious states that we should be concerned about the most. The interconnectedness of computer systems and their use in controlling and maintaining our infrastructures mean we are increasingly vulnerable to a devastating attack. An enemy that could seize control of our electricity grid or our banking system could bring our nation to its knees without firing a shot. The nature of warfare has changed, and as a result we must change our defences. </ParaText><ParaText id="7473850">Canada's national security requires being prepared for the security warfare threats that we face. The government has been slow to address cyber-threats and has seen a number of serious incidents occur, with no substantive legislative response for seven years. I am pleased that the government has finally chosen to act, and I am hopeful that we in the House can help improve this legislation. Cybersecurity is of paramount importance in the modern world.

Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7450418"> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="11554508" Type="3">S-4</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Identification of Criminals Act and to make related amendments to other acts (COVID-19 response and other measures).</ParaText><ParaText id="7450419">The judicial system has been facing a series of delays in cases proceeding to trial, which has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conservatives have raised concerns about the delays and the potential for criminals to walk free due to the Supreme Court's Jordan decision, which said that no more than 18 months can pass between the laying of a charge and the end of trial cases in provincial courts, or 30 months for cases in superior courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450420">We have raised our concerns over the delays in the judicial system a number of times during the pandemic, both in the House and through the media, so it is good that the Liberals are finally listening. I understand that sometimes they have different priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450421">The court system scrambled to adapt and learn how to function during the pandemic, and it was obvious that changes were needed. I could have made this speech at the height of the pandemic, when the need was very urgent. The government recognized the need then and introduced Bill <Document DbId="11102980" Type="3">C-23</Document>, but it was obviously not a priority. That bill died on the Order Paper when the House was dissolved by the Liberals for their unnecessary election. However, as with many efforts of the government, I suppose we can consider it to be better late than never, though it seems sometimes that on truly pressing issues, such as inflation, for the Liberals to do anything, it is more never than late.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450422"> It is indeed important to support the courts in the technological transition that has been stimulated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also important to be as prepared as possible for a future pandemic or similar disruptions.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450423">In the past two years, we have all discovered new ways of doing business. Some of those ways have been beneficial, others arguably not as much. So too is the case with this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450424"> For justice to be truly done, it must be seen to be done. Any citizen has the right to attend court and observe the proceedings. In the past, that has naturally been a right that could be limited by the physical space of the courtroom. Allowing virtual proceedings would change that limitation while bringing with it the issue of controlling the dissemination of images from the proceedings. We have gone from cameras not being allowed into a courtroom to everyone having the ability to take screenshots or even videos of the proceedings.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450425">There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt throughout our criminal justice system. Problems that perhaps we did not realize we had have been brought into focus. A modernization of the system is long overdue. The pandemic has shown us that action is very necessary now.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450426">With the technological tools that are now available to us, it makes sense to allow, as this bill would, peace officers to apply for and obtain a warrant using telecommunications rather than having to appear in person before a judge. This would not take away from the necessity of the officer to answer any questions as to whether the warrant is really necessary. The legal necessities would not change, but there is a savings to the taxpayer and the environment in the officer not having to drive to appear before a judge.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7450427">We are all aware that the criminal justice system has been subjected to delays in proceedings, and sometimes that was exacerbated by the pandemic. While justice delayed is justice denied, no one wants to see a criminal walk free because the system could not bring them to trial fast enough. </ParaText><ParaText id="7450428">The reforms suggested in this bill are small but incremental. It is important to remember that the fundamentals of justice would still be being observed, and that the increased use of teleconferencing in the courts would not take away from the fundamental rights of the accused to appear in person, but many, given the choice, might prefer to appear by video conference. This, incidentally, could reduce their legal fees since their lawyer would not have to be with them at the courthouse waiting for their case to be called.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450429">One thing that concerns me with these reforms is the issue of fairness. I am not sure how the government can address that. Appearing by video in court proceedings requires access to technology that, at this point, is not available to every Canadian. Not everyone has the financial resources to own a computer. Not everyone has high-speed Internet access available to them. Certainly, the government does not have the resources to provide that.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450430">At the same time, I recognize that there are other different burdens that come with having to make a court appearance in person that could bring with it the expense and hardship of travel. I am not certain how we can provide equal access to the justice system for all Canadians, but I know we have to try to keep improving the system until we get it right.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450431">One area where I have serious concerns is the proposal in the bill that would allow the jury selection process to be done by video conference in some circumstances. While this would certainly make it less onerous for prospective jurors to take part in the selection process from their home or workplace, it does raise some privacy concerns. While technology makes remote appearances possible, technology could also be used to subvert the process, not to mention the right of an accused to see those who are to pass judgment on his or her case.</ParaText><ParaText id="7450432">In Canada, an accused has a right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers, but there are times when, for security reasons, the jurors are anonymous. With the availability of facial recognition software, it is easy to imagine that prospective jurors appearing by video conference could be easily identified. This could leave them open to harassment or attempts to influence a jury's decision. That may sound unlikely, but if we are concerned for the administration of justice, it must be considered. Has the government considered how to deal with this issue?</ParaText><ParaText id="7450433">This bill is not perfect, but neither is our justice system. The question we as parliamentarians must ask ourselves is this: Does the legislation make positive improvements to the administration of justice in our country, even if it is not perfect? If so, then we should probably support it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="63674" IsProceduralTerm="0">Backlogs</Term><Term Id="54688" IsProceduralTerm="0">Biometrics</Term><Term Id="200792" IsProceduralTerm="0">COVID-19</Term><Term Id="39080" IsProceduralTerm="0">Equal opportunities</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39701" IsProceduralTerm="0">Information technology</Term><Term Id="39787" IsProceduralTerm="0">Jury and jurors</Term><Term Id="39788" IsProceduralTerm="0">Justice system</Term><Term Id="54772" IsProceduralTerm="0">Legal procedures</Term><Term Id="40278" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pandemic</Term><Term Id="176856" IsProceduralTerm="0">R. v.

Certainly, that is true for this bill, Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document>, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382948">It would be so nice to live in a world where there was no need for laws to protect the environment because everyone, individuals and corporations, understood their responsibilities and acted accordingly. However, we live in the real world, which means there is a need for legislators to enact laws to ensure that what should come naturally does indeed take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382949">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members opposite for their concern for our environment. Although there are times when we differ on the best methods of doing that, I know they have a deep concern for the future of the planet, one that is shared by me and my colleagues.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382950">As we discuss the bill today, I hope that my contribution will be taken in the spirit in which it is given. Perhaps no legislation is perfect, but I am hopeful this bill, which has seen several revisions in the Senate, can be further improved by the contributions of members of the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382951">The role of government is to protect citizens. None of us would dispute that. Bill <Document DbId="11558854" Type="3">S-5</Document> recognizes that every Canadian has the right to a healthy environment and that the federal government has a responsibility to protect that right. That right is not defined in the act, which may give some people cause for concern, but it is good to know that the government has not forgotten the importance of the definition and that it is still to come. I hope we will see it later on.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382952"> I am surprised the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> needed two years to develop an implementation framework for how the right to a healthy environment would be considered in the administration of this bill, balanced with social, economic, health, scientific and other relevant factors, but I would rather that he take the time to get it right. Too often it seems the current government has acted hastily, to the regret of the Canadian people, so I will not complain about the delay in this case, although I should point out that the minister has had plenty of time to consider it, given that the government introduced it in the last Parliament but failed to make its passage a priority unfortunately.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382953">What worries me is that the current government has a habit of making pronouncements that highlight its environmental plans but does not follow through. I am hoping this time it means what it says. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382954">We all know that the Liberal government has yet to meet a single carbon emissions reduction target it has set for itself. That is nothing new. It is true. It talks about climate change, using words like “crisis” and “emergency”, but then acts as if it does not believe its own words. In fact, carbon emissions have gone up under the current Liberal government. It cannot deny it and it will not deny it.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382955"> The carbon tax is an absolute failure. Not only has it not reduced emissions, but the Parliamentary Budget Officer has made it clear that the majority of Canadians actually pay more in carbon taxes than they collect in rebates. So far this year, the commissioner of the environment has released 10 reports on the performance of the current Liberal government with respect to the protection of the environment. More than half of the reports showed that the government was failing to meet its targets.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382956">It could be said that this legislation is long overdue. The last major revision to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act was more than 20 years ago. It goes back to 1999 under Prime Minister Chrétien. We know so much more today about climate change than we did then and about the need for action and making a meaningful effort.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7382957">This legislation would modernize the chemicals management plan in Canada. It is hard to see how anyone would disagree with that objective. Taking a risk-based approach to chemicals management is something I feel has broad-based support. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382958">I am so pleased to see the efforts to remove unnecessary red tape from our environmental regulations. All too often, it seems the goal of the government is to make life more difficult for Canadians as individuals and for Canadian businesses. It will probably surprise many people to see that sometimes the Liberals actually take the effects of their legislation into consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382959">This bill is, I am sure, not the only legislation we will see from the government designed to strengthen environmental protection on behalf of the Canadian people. It stresses chemicals management and toxic substances, which are not the only areas of environmental protection that are concerning to Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382960">I seem to remember the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, several years ago, made recommendations regarding national standards for clean air and clean water. Perhaps those will be included when the <Affiliation DbId="278910" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> tells us exactly what is meant by Canadians having a right to a healthy environment. Certainly, one would think clean air and clean water would be essential to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382961">As this bill goes next to the committee stage for further study before being brought back to the House, it would be well to consider what we would like the legislation to accomplish. As I stated previously, we are in the House committed to protecting our environment. Canada is the envy of the world for our clean water, our clean air and the natural beauty of our country. We are all committed as parliamentarians to ensuring future generations enjoy the same healthy environment we have today. Our legacy will be defined by how, and only by how, we treat the planet that has been entrusted to us. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382962">There seems to be general agreement that revisions to our environmental protection laws are long overdue. Perhaps the government has not acted quickly enough, but it is acting. Perhaps the provisions of this bill do not go as far as some of us would have liked to see, and that is understandable. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382963">When this bill was examined by the Senate, it was subject to considerable amendments before it was passed and given to us for consideration. Some of those amendments make sense to me. Other suggestions, such as removing the word “cost” from “cost-effective” in the precautionary principle, would seem to me to be in need of more discussion. </ParaText><ParaText id="7382964">I understand whatever form this bill finally takes, it will not be as all-encompassing as some would hope. The reality is that rarely, if ever, we will find a perfect piece of legislation. I would respectfully suggest perfection is even less likely when dealing with the offerings of the Liberal government. However, in this case, it seems to have addressed a need. I look forward to taking questions. </ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="55663" IsProceduralTerm="0">Civil and human rights</Term><Term Id="39071" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental health</Term><Term Id="39075" IsProceduralTerm="0">Environmental protection</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39400" IsProceduralTerm="0">Government performance</Term><Term Id="40646" IsProceduralTerm="0">Regulation</Term><Term Id="63059" IsProceduralTerm="0">Risk management</Term><Term Id="219975" IsProceduralTerm="0">S-5, An Act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, to make related amendments to the Food and Drugs Act and to repeal the Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Virtual Elimination Act</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="40832" IsProceduralTerm="1">Senate bills</Term><Term Id="41154" IsProceduralTerm="0">Toxic substances</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12030438" Hour="15" Minute="46"><Person><FirstName>Julie</FirstName><LastName>Vignola</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Beauport—Limoilou</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12030599" Hour="15" Minute="56"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="12030662" EventId="11895041" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11895041/?ml=en" Sequence="266" Page="9086" PdfPage="50" TypeId="38" Date="2022-10-31" Hour="15" Minute="57" Second="53" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=12030662" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Oct%2031%202022%20%203:57PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=12030662"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="11895041"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7382968">Madam Speaker, I indicated that we are supporting this bill going to the committee stage, which we believe is very important and worthwhile.</ParaText><ParaText id="7382969">As far as policy, I do not think the government has a plan for the environment.

It is sad because Canadians would like Canada to be a place where we trust each other. It is disturbing because the erosion of trust in our society causes friction and discord. We have to wonder where it will end, and whether we can continue to function as a society if we do not have any trust or respect for each other.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356765">As a Conservative, I find it easy to mistrust the Liberal Party. It has a track record of actions and politics that I think are detrimental to Canadian society. At the same time, I acknowledge that the members opposite, despite their political affiliation, all put their names forward for election because they had, and all still have, a strong desire to serve Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356766">Last year, in a Maru public opinion poll, members of Parliament ranked at almost the very bottom of the list when it came to respect for their profession. We can take little pleasure in being more respected by Canadians than owners of social media platforms or car salespeople and advertising professionals. The lack of respect for politicians is a sign of the times, but I think honest reflection would be that all too often the practitioners of politics have behaved in a way that loses them the respect of the people they serve. Once again, I find that sad.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356767">I bring up the matter of trust because that is the purpose of the legislation we are debating today. In the poll I referred to earlier, firefighters, nurses, doctors and farmers were all high on the list. Judges were in the middle of the pack. Judges command the respect of the majority of Canadians, but perhaps not as much as they used to.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356768"> Bill <Document DbId="11501554" Type="3">C-9</Document>, with its amendments to the Judges Act, is an attempt to strengthen an integral component of our Canadian system of justice. This bill would amend the Judges Act to replace the process through which the conduct of federally appointed judges is reviewed by the Canadian Judicial Council. It establishes a new process for reviewing allegations of misconduct that are not serious enough to warrant a judge's removal from office, and it makes changes to the process by which recommendations regarding removal from office can be made to the minister of justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356769"> As with the provisions it replaces, this new process also applies to persons, other than judges, who are appointed under an Act of Parliament to hold office during good behaviour. Bill <Document DbId="11501554" Type="3">C-9</Document> modifies the existing judicial review process by establishing a process for complaints serious enough to warrant removal from office, and another for offences that would warrant other sanctions, such as counselling, continuing education and reprimands. It seems to me that there is a benefit to outlining this process.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356770"> The bill also states the reasons a judge could be removed from office, including infirmity and misconduct. I am looking forward to when this legislation goes to the justice committee to be examined in greater detail.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356771">As well, I would like to hear the opinion of Dr. Benjamin Roebuck, the new federal ombudsman for victims of crime on frustrations victims have had with the judicial review process. I wish to congratulate Dr. Roebuck on his new position, which he takes up this coming Monday.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356772">It is a pity though that the Liberals took more than a year to fill such an important position. A cynic might suggest they do not think the rights of victims are a priority. I am not a cynic. I know the Liberals do care about the victims of crime. Perhaps the delay in finding a new ombudsman for the victims of crime was because so many government resources were devoted to the ArriveCAN app that no-one remembered to put up the job posting.</ParaText><ParaText id="7356773">I think it is fair to say that Bill <Document DbId="11501554" Type="3">C-9</Document> is about increasing trust in an age of mistrust. I do not want to live in a society where the very institutions of democracy are threatened because they have lost the trust of the people. Canadian judges already enjoy a high level of trust. However, as I noted earlier, they do not top the list. If this legislation would indeed help increase the public's trust in the judiciary, then it is worthy of our support.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="214117" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-9, An Act to amend the Judges Act</Term><Term Id="189862" IsProceduralTerm="0">Complaints</Term><Term Id="69339" IsProceduralTerm="0">Federal judges</Term><Term Id="72144" IsProceduralTerm="0">Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39786" IsProceduralTerm="0">Judiciary</Term><Term Id="67508" IsProceduralTerm="0">Political appointments</Term><Term Id="65720" IsProceduralTerm="0">Public office holders</Term><Term Id="107260" IsProceduralTerm="0">Public trust</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="41265" IsProceduralTerm="0">Victims of crime</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="12001993" Hour="13" Minute="23"><Person><FirstName>Charlie</FirstName><LastName>Angus</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Timmins—James Bay</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="12001498" Hour="13" Minute="29"><Person><FirstName>Alexandra</FirstName><LastName>Mendès</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Brossard—Saint-Lambert</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="11998243" Title="Hansard - 114" TypeId="37" Date="2022-10-20" Time="10:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/114/HAN114-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="11995782" EventId="11865003" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11865003/?ml=en" Sequence="174" Page="8597" PdfPage="39" TypeId="38" Date="2022-10-20" Hour="14" Minute="05" Second="53" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11995782" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Oct%2020%202022%20%202:05PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11995782"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Statements by Members</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Affordability for Students</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="11865003"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7353718">Mr. Speaker, runaway inflation is hurting Canadian students.

According to Wikipedia:</ParaText><ParaText id="7312337"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">...inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="7312338">Wikipedia also tells us:</ParaText><ParaText id="7312339"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">High or unpredictable inflation rates are regarded as harmful to an overall economy. They add inefficiencies in the market, and make it difficult for companies to budget or plan long-term. Inflation can act as a drag on productivity as companies are forced to shift resources away from products and services to focus on profit and losses from currency inflation. Uncertainty about the future purchasing power of money discourages investment and saving. Inflation can also impose hidden tax increases. For instance, inflated earnings push taxpayers into higher income tax rates unless the tax brackets are indexed to inflation.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="7312340"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With high inflation, purchasing power is redistributed from those on fixed nominal incomes, such as some pensioners whose pensions are not indexed to the price level, towards those with variable incomes whose earnings may better keep pace with the inflation. This redistribution of purchasing power will also occur between international trading partners. Where fixed exchange rates are imposed, higher inflation in one economy than another will cause the first economy's exports to become more expensive and affect the balance of trade. There can also be negative effects to trade from an increased instability in currency exchange prices caused by unpredictable inflation.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="7312341">This is Wikipedia. It is common information there, but the difference is that some understand it and some do not. Some refuse to even look at it or understand it. To put it simply, in terms that even a Liberal can understand, inflation harms the economy and hurts the people of Canada. Government policies should not make inflation higher. That should be a common understanding. It is simple and should be something that we all should live by.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312342">This now brings us to the Liberals' response to inflation, which is to create Bill <Document DbId="11924005" Type="3">C-31</Document>, an act respecting cost of living relief measures related to dental care and rental housing. The Liberals, with their imperfect understanding of inflation, are trying to make things better. They are ignoring the economic experts who say that increasing government spending adds to inflation. The Liberals' solution does not fix the problem, but will just make it worse.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312343">It may come as a surprise to the Liberals, but their children's dental care is not a high priority for many Canadian families these days. Parents wish they could be more concerned about dental health and the state of their children's teeth, but when they are having difficulties finding the money to feed their children they are not spending much time booking dentist appointments.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7312344">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, as we discovered a couple of years ago, does not know the cost of a pound of bacon. Just to let him know, it has gone up again. Grocery prices are up by 10.8% on average, rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. Fish is up 10%. Butter is up 16%. Milk is up 21%. Eggs are up 10%. Margarine is up 37%. Bread, rolls and buns are up 17%. Dry or fresh pasta is up 32%. Fresh fruit is up by 13%. Oranges are up by 11%. Apples are up by 18%. Coffee is up by 14%. Soup is up by 19%. Lettuce is up by 12%. Potatoes are up by 10%. A family of four are spending an average of $1,200 more a year for groceries than they did in 2021. As well as record food prices, they have to deal with increases in heating, gasoline and housing costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312345">Canadians are having to make hard choices about whether to put gas in the car in order to get to work in the morning, or put food on the table. This should not be happening in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The government does not seem to understand that it is part of the problem. It says to spend, spend, spend and hopes that the problem will go away. If we ask any economist, they will tell us a government cannot curtail inflation by spending.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312346">The Liberal government is driving up the cost of living. The government's proposals do little to solve the problem. Proposals on dental care and housing will provide jobs for civil servants, but will not help most Canadians. The GST rebate will provide some welcome relief, but it is short-term and will not address the real problem: Inflationary deficits and taxes are driving up costs at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years, and that rebate will not pay for very many groceries.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312347">As government spending increases, the deficit rises and the national debt increases. Today's spending will be paid for by our children and grandchildren, who will not thank us for our actions today.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312348">If the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was serious about making life more affordable for workers, families and seniors, he would cancel his planned carbon tax increases immediately. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is increasing the carbon tax on Canadians by three times, tripling it, and he is suggesting that he wants to help Canadians. If he wanted to help Canadians, he would not increase the carbon tax three times.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312349">Canadian families are struggling with rising costs due to Liberal inflation. Now is not the time to raise their tax burden and make their lives worse. Instead of freezing taxes, the government is raising taxes on people who are struggling to make ends meet. Inflation is making groceries unaffordable for many people. The government is making things worse with its taxes and inflationary spending.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312350">Those things combined are raising the stress on millions of Canadians. Many are turning to food banks as the only way to feed their families. Here in Ottawa, inflation is being blamed for record-high food bank usage. Food banks in Toronto say they are facing the highest demand in their history. In Edmonton, the University of Alberta's Campus Food Bank reported 200 new clients in September alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="7312351">Raising the tax burden on Canadians so they have to turn to food banks to feed their children may be the Liberal policy, but it is not the policy of a compassionate government. Last year, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> asked Canadians to forgive him for not thinking of the monetary policy. Given the fiscal trouble individual Canadians and the entire nation face, I do not think we are going to do that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="220529" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-31, An Act respecting cost of living relief measures related to dental care and rental housing</Term><Term Id="238249" IsProceduralTerm="0">Canadian Dental Care Plan</Term><Term Id="173426" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon pricing</Term><Term Id="38425" IsProceduralTerm="0">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="38527" IsProceduralTerm="0">Children</Term><Term Id="62794" IsProceduralTerm="0">Cost of living</Term><Term Id="39250" IsProceduralTerm="0">Food banks</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39690" IsProceduralTerm="0">Inflation</Term><Term Id="57608" IsProceduralTerm="0">Oral and dental health</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11954197" Hour="13" Minute="28"><Person><FirstName>Mark</FirstName><LastName>Gerretsen</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Kingston and the Islands</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11954211" Hour="13" Minute="39"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="11954212" EventId="11831260" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11831260/?ml=en" Sequence="69" Page="7998" PdfPage="24" TypeId="38" Date="2022-10-03" Hour="13" Minute="40" Second="41" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11954212" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Oct%20%203%202022%20%201:40PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11954212"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Cost of Living Relief Act, No. 2

During her visits to this country, she touched so many lives. To the world, she was the Queen of England. She was also very much the Queen of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294511">Even though they had never met the Queen, she impacted my wife's parents in a deeply personal way. Like so many have done, Sam and Rabha came to Canada as immigrants from a country outside the British Commonwealth. They did not grow up with Canadian traditions. Having a monarch was new to them. They were seeking a new life, a better life, and were determined to embrace all that Canada could offer.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294512">They had seen news coverage of the royal visit to Canada. When their daughter was born on the anniversary of the Queen's coronation, my father-in-law insisted that their new daughter be named Elizabeth, in honour of Her Majesty. They wrote to the Queen at Buckingham Palace to tell her of the event.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294513">In the past week, thousands of people around the world have paid tribute to Elizabeth II. I am not sure there is anything I could say that would add to those words. She was an inspiration to all of us in public life, leading by example and following traditions she learned as a child. She understood the concepts of service and duty in ways that we would, too, all want to emulate.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294514">One of the Queen's strengths was her humility. The word “queen” brings to mind someone exalted, above ordinary people, yet as thousands of Canadians who have met her can tell us, Elizabeth II was deeply concerned with and interested in people, no matter where they came from or their social status. Her Christian faith infused her interactions with others.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294515">Our nation has lost someone who, for most of us, has been a constant presence in all of our lives. We knew her death was inevitable at some point, but we secretly believed that she would live forever.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294516">In this period of mourning, we feel somewhat adrift on an uncharted ocean. We are not alone in those feelings. Elizabeth II was not just a queen, not just the head of the Commonwealth and not just a symbol of enduring stability in a turbulent world. She was also a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother, and her loss is felt by her family more deeply than by any of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="7294517">For King Charles III and the rest of the royal family, the hearts of Canadians are with them in this time of mourning. I thank them for sharing their mother and grandmother with us. Canada and the world are richer because of her. May God comfort them as they mourn.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="38802" IsProceduralTerm="0">Deaths and funerals</Term><Term Id="192417" IsProceduralTerm="0">Elizabeth II, Her Majesty Queen</Term><Term Id="40976" IsProceduralTerm="1">Statements by Members</Term><Term Id="41190" IsProceduralTerm="1">Tributes</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11923817" Hour="11" Minute="18"><Person><FirstName>Tracy</FirstName><LastName>Gray</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Kelowna—Lake Country</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11923869" Hour="11" Minute="26"><Person><FirstName>Chris</FirstName><LastName>Lewis</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Essex</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="11899661" Title="Hansard - 93" TypeId="37" Date="2022-06-21" Time="10:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/093/HAN093-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="11899442" EventId="11785013" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11785013/?ml=en" Sequence="365" Page="7110" PdfPage="58" TypeId="38" Date="2022-06-21" Hour="17" Minute="13" Second="31" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11899442" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Jun%2021%202022%20%205:13PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11899442"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Criminal Code</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="11785013"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7260123">Madam Speaker, from time to time, I have been critical of the record of the Liberal government when it comes to fiscal matters. It has consistently shown that it has no clue how an economy works and what policies are good for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260124">In fairness though, I feel I must congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="278921" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> for their unintentional boost to the Canadian economy with Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>. It is so rare that a Liberal policy is designed to provide economic stimulus that I feel this is worth noting.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260125"><I>Maclean's</I> magazine's Ottawa bureau chief Shannon Proudfoot featured an interview with gun shop owner Ryan Simper. He said that after this bill was announced, his store sold every handgun it had in stock. Apparently, there is no better stimulus for the economy than scarcity of a product.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260126">Maybe if the Liberals truly want to stimulate the economy, they should try other bans and see if that helps. I encourage them to look for areas where there may be an abundance of supply and lagging sales, and see if they can help those sectors of the economy. Maybe if they banned broccoli, for example, it would help vegetable sales. In the absence of a true economic plan, such acts would at least show them to be doing something worth while.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260127">Handguns are already well regulated in this country. Anyone who wishes to own one legally must take a safety course and undergo background checks. It is an extensive, time-consuming process, and one that gun owners understand is there to provide reasonable protections for society.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260128">However, those protections, like this bill, do nothing to stop the flow of illegal handguns in Canada. Gun violence and gun crime problems in Canada do not come from those who have taken a firearms safety course and have been cleared for gun ownership after their background check.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260129">Responsible handgun owners, the ones targeted by this bill, are collectors or target shooters. They are not criminals. Those who want to join their ranks should not be prohibited from doing so merely because the government does not know how to deal with crime and the flow of illegal firearms being smuggled into Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260130">To me, it seems that the government, not knowing how to deal with the problem, wants to pretend to show the public that it is doing something. This bill will not help, but the government will not admit that. I think everyone in the House can agree that both gun violence and gun crime are not acceptable in Canadian society. Where we might differ is how to best deal with the issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260131">It has been my experience that the Liberals are so blinded by their ideology that suggestions for improvement to their legislation fall on deaf ears. Nevertheless, I would like to offer them some ideas to accomplish their goal of reducing gun crime in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260132">The idea of strengthening border controls and authorities to combat firearms smuggling, trafficking and related offences is something we can all agree on. I call on the government to make that the focus of this legislation. Drop the attacks on legal, law-abiding gun owners and concentrate on those who are already breaking Canadian law.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260133">I should also point out that there are contradictions in this piece of legislation. There are some individuals who will be exempted from the provisions and would still be allowed to purchase handguns. That includes elite sports shooters who compete or coach in a handgun discipline recognized by the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee. The exemption makes sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260134">We Canadians are proud of our Olympians, and we have had some success at pistol shooting competitions. In 1984, Linda Thom won the gold medal in pistol shooting at the Los Angeles Olympics, the first Canadian woman to win an individual gold medal in the summer Olympics since 1928 and the first Canadian to win a gold medal in the summer Olympics since 1968. She was given the honour of carrying Canada's flag at the closing ceremonies.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260135">As an elite shooter, she would still be allowed to purchase a handgun if this legislation were to pass unchanged. However, what about those who want to follow in her footsteps? </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7260136">I cannot think of any sport where one becomes a world-class athlete overnight. It takes hard work, dedication and training, usually for years. Wayne Gretzky had to learn to skate before he could even begin to put a puck in the net. How will the next Linda Thom become available, or a future Canadian Olympian become an elite shooter? </ParaText><ParaText id="7260137">Even members of the government must understand that it requires practice, practice and more practice for a shooter to reach the level necessary to compete at the Olympics. Under Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>, new participants in this sport would not be allowed to purchase a handgun to practice with. Apparently, the Liberals have decided that this is one sport they do not want to see Canada excel in.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260138">The Conservatives have always stood for common sense firearms safety and strong consequences for those who commit firearms offences. We do not understand why the government wants to punish law-abiding firearms owners and make it difficult, if not impossible, for those who might want to take up a sport such as pistol shooting.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260139">The government was first elected in 2015, and gun crime has gone up steadily each year, despite its arbitrary bans and its complicated and expensive buyback program. This increase in gun crime is not because those who own weapons legally are suddenly turning to lawlessness, but because illegal weapons are being smuggled into Canada and used by criminals. It has taken seven long years for the government to understand that there is a problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="7260140">This belated realization comes only after it blocked a Conservative bill to toughen consequences for gun smuggling. If only it had concentrated on crime and criminals, I could have applauded its better-late-than-never efforts. Instead, it is once again targeting responsible gun owners who have committed no crimes, which makes us wonder how serious it is about really being tough on crime. After all, this is a government that intends to remove through other legislation mandatory minimum sentences for robbery with a firearm, weapons trafficking, discharging a firearm with intent, using a firearm in the commission of offences, and possession of a firearm knowing its possession is unauthorized, and more.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260141">Members will forgive me for thinking that this new revelation that gun smuggling needs to be dealt with is just a lot of words. There are already laws on the books to deal with such acts if the government has the will and the police have the resources to enforce them. If it were serious about crime, it would not be trying to target responsible gun-owning Canadians who have followed all the rules and restrictions that come with gun ownership. Of course, they are an easy target for a government that does not seem to know how to address the issues of most concern to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="7260142">Canadians are tired of false promises from the government. This bill once again proves that the Liberals do not understand where they should be focusing their efforts in order to protect the people of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="218985" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-21, An Act to amend certain Acts and to make certain consequential amendments (firearms)</Term><Term Id="39200" IsProceduralTerm="0">Firearms</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="39835" IsProceduralTerm="0">Law, justice and rights</Term><Term Id="67209" IsProceduralTerm="0">Restricted firearms</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="103867" IsProceduralTerm="0">Shooting sports</Term><Term Id="40897" IsProceduralTerm="0">Smuggling</Term><Term Id="41277" IsProceduralTerm="0">Violent crime</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11899026" Hour="17" Minute="12"><Person><FirstName>George</FirstName><LastName>Chahal</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Calgary Skyview</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11899493" Hour="17" Minute="22"><Person><FirstName>Mark</FirstName><LastName>Gerretsen</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Kingston and the Islands</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="11899198" EventId="11785092" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11785092/?ml=en" Sequence="367" Page="7111" PdfPage="59" TypeId="38" Date="2022-06-21" Hour="17" Minute="23" Second="41" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11899198" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Jun%2021%202022%20%205:23PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11899198"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Criminal Code</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="11785092"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7260146">Madam Speaker, from time to time, it is nice to correct some of the facts.

We may not all be immigrants, but all of us, even our first nations, can trace our roots to another place. With such diversity, it is important to celebrate our heritage and to remember our roots as we come together to forge this still young nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110579">Our neighbour to the south, the United States, has for years proclaimed itself to be a melting pot. Those who go there are expected, to a certain degree, to forget their former culture, to melt together to form one America, with a homogenous culture and vision. That was especially apparent when it came to language. How well that has worked in recent years is a matter of debate. The American dream may not be as accessible as it once was, though the ideal remains strong. Different communities are making their voices heard in a way that did not happen in the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110580"> In Canada, we have never been a melting pot, never a place where immigrants were expected to become something completely new. Sociologists refer to the Canadian experiment not as a melting pot but as a mosaic, a place where each cultural group retains its distinct identity while contributing to the nation as a whole. In Canada, we celebrate our differences and try to learn from them, to better our cultural understanding of what makes our nation a great nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110581">Hindu heritage month would celebrate Hindu Canadians and the contributions they have made to the socio-economic development of Canada. It would highlight their service to Canadian society, the richness of Hindu heritage and the contributions Hindus have made to the arts and sciences, both in Canada and around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110582">Hindu heritage month would bring to the forefront the Hindu religion, something many Canadians know little about. As a religion, Hinduism is one of the oldest in the world, with almost a billion adherents worldwide, dating back beyond recorded history. Today, there are nearly 900 million practising Hindus worldwide, about 9% of the world's population. It is the world's third-largest religion, after Christianity and Islam. While most Hindus call India home, there are more than half a million living in Canada. They follow a rich religious tradition, one with high ethical standards and practices designed for both individual and cultural enlightenment.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110583">The first Hindus came to Canada more than a century ago. They are found in every province and territory. Each one has a different story of how they or their ancestors came to this country, and I do believe the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278409" Type="2">Nepean</Affiliation> has his own story, too. What they have in common is their desire to become part of Canadian society and to contribute to its well-being.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110584"> When I think about the contributions of Hindus to Canadian society, the first name that comes to mind is that of the late Deepak Obhrai, who served this House and all Canadians as the member of Parliament for Calgary Forest Lawn from 1997 until his death in 2019. Deepak was a proud Canadian, an air traffic controller who retrained as an accountant when he came to Canada and opened his own small business. Before becoming an MP, he served the community as president of the India-Canada Association of Calgary, the Monterey Park Community Association, and the Hindu Society of Calgary. He also served as a vice-president of the National Indo-Canadian Council. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7110585">When first elected, Deepak served as an opposition MP. Then, when the Conservatives formed government, he became parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs and to the minister of international co-operation. In those roles, he was able to visit other countries as a representative of his adopted country. His official visits took him to more than 100 different lands. He could tell stories about his adventures in practically every country in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110586">Deepak was known for his support of immigrants in general and the Hindu community in particular. He may have lived in Calgary, but he was known to every Canadian of Hindu or Indian descent. He was proud of his roots and proud of his adopted country and the opportunities it offered to immigrants like him. He understood that there are no limits to what may be accomplished by those who make Canada their home. </ParaText><ParaText id="7110587">In 2017, he ran for the leadership of the federal Conservative Party. His goal was to become the first Hindu prime minister of Canada. He dared to dream big, even knowing the odds were against him. That is the Hindu spirit. His presence enriched the campaign and the Conservative Party at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="7110588"> Deepak Obhrai's story, as I have said, is but one of so many success stories that can be told of Hindus in Canada. All too often, though, these stories are not well known outside a limited community. Setting aside November every year as Hindu heritage month would allow the Hindu community a platform to present their history, their culture and the stories of their people to a wider audience. As Canadians, we like to celebrate our diversity. We are a nation of stories and storytellers, painting a rich tapestry of cultures that is envied by nations the world over. </ParaText><ParaText id="7110589">That tapestry has been made stronger by the contributions of Hindu Canadians. Whether their origins are in India, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Eastern Africa, like my friend Deepak Obhrai, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka, their presence has enriched Canadian society. They have become an important part of the Canadian mosaic, and it is only fitting that we recognize that fact. </ParaText><ParaText id="7110590">I am confident that all the members in this House will support the member for <Affiliation DbId="278409" Type="2">Nepean</Affiliation> in his desire to see the establishment of Hindu heritage month. I congratulate the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="278409" Type="2">Nepean</Affiliation> for bringing this bill before the House and thank him for his service to Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="180512" IsProceduralTerm="0">Hindu Heritage Month</Term><Term Id="85120" IsProceduralTerm="0">Hinduism and Hindus</Term><Term Id="39635" IsProceduralTerm="0">Immigration and immigrants</Term><Term Id="214073" IsProceduralTerm="0">M-42</Term><Term Id="11189" IsProceduralTerm="0">Obhrai, Deepak</Term><Term Id="65691" IsProceduralTerm="0">Parliamentarians</Term><Term Id="40500" IsProceduralTerm="1">Private Members' Motions</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11737849" Hour="11" Minute="22"><Person><FirstName>Chandra</FirstName><LastName>Arya</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Nepean</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11737231" Hour="11" Minute="31"><Person><FirstName>Martin</FirstName><LastName>Champoux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Drummond</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="11740002" EventId="11650076" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11650076/?ml=en" Sequence="204" Page="4600" PdfPage="34" TypeId="38" Date="2022-05-02" Hour="15" Minute="06" Second="02" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11740002" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28May%20%202%202022%20%203:06PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11740002"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Oral Question Period</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Health</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="11650076"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="05">(1505)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7111058">Mr. Speaker, Canadians have followed public health measures and have made tremendous sacrifices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is a simple number that even a child can understand. I bring that to the House's attention because it seems me that members opposite have lost touch with reality, while at the same time losing their ability to manage Canada's economy. Let us go back to basics in the hope that the Liberals and their NDP friends can gain a glimmer of understanding. I will try to use simple numbers, ones that even a Liberal can understand.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109459">Bill <Document DbId="11496808" Type="3">C-8</Document>, the economic and fiscal update 2021, adds an additional $70 billion to government spending and brings our national debt to $1.2 trillion. Until the government, such a number was inconceivable, which means the members opposite can be forgiven for not understanding the number, even if Canadians cannot forgive them for their spendthrift ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109460">A trillion dollars is a million million dollars. That is a one with 12 zeroes, if we are writing it on paper. It is tough to visualize a trillion dollars. However, if we were to take that debt and pay it off with loonie coins, the weight of cash would be 8,400,000,000 kilograms. That is still a difficult number to comprehend, but since the Liberals have no plan to ever reduce the debt, let alone pay it, maybe it does not matter if we cannot visualize it.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109461">Let us look at it in a different way. Using imperial measures, this debt of 1.2 trillion loonies would weigh 7,860,428 tonnes. This is also an unfathomable number, but let us visualize this. The Liberal disaster weighs 150 times as much as the RMS <I>Titanic</I>, the unsinkable ship that went down off the coast of Newfoundland 110 years ago this month in one of the biggest maritime disasters in history, or of all time, to be specific.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109462">The government's fiscal management is a disaster that is 150 times as bad. It is no wonder the Liberals hide behind the big numbers that they hope people do not understand. They have used the pandemic as an excuse to make changes to the economy, to bring in $176 billion in new spending completely unrelated to COVID-19. They are hoping Canadians will not notice, that they will be too distracted by events to notice that the Liberals are spending without any concerns about the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109463">Canadians are, on the whole, a financially responsible people. We know that we should not spend more than we earn and that bills must be paid. We know that money for government programs comes from taxes paid by each Canadian. Canadians understand that we are already taxed at the breaking point. The taxpayers of this country cannot afford new taxes and tax increases. At least most Canadians understand that. Those who do not apparently become Liberal or NDP members of Parliament. Those two parties seem determined to spend this country into bankruptcy.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109464">I was born in a country where the government has had to declare bankruptcy. The suffering of ordinary citizens there is heartbreaking. I do not want to see this happen here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109465">People in my riding of Edmonton Manning are concerned about rising prices. They feel they will not be able to make ends meet. They want to know when the Liberals will get serious about the economy. They are not happy that the answer seems to be “never”.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109466">Inflation was 6.7% in March, the highest level in more than 30 years. The government response has been a collective shrug. It is an international problem, they say, as they add more inflationary taxes to Canadians' burdens. As gasoline prices reach record highs, the Liberals' response is to raise the tax on fuel to make things more expensive for Canadians. Gasoline costs are up almost 40% in the last year, and groceries are up by almost 10%. Furniture prices are up about 8% in March alone. Housing prices have doubled under the government.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7109467">Young Canadians used to dream of graduating from university, getting a job and buying their first home. These were the milestones of adulthood and rites of passage. With the Liberal government, that dream has changed to a nightmare of crippling student debt and living with parents forever because they will never be able to afford a house of their own.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109468">My constituents are concluding that either the Liberals do not understand the problem or they do not care. Canadians deserve a government that will take real action to fight the cost of living crisis and outline a clear commitment to control inflation. We will not find that in Bill <Document DbId="11496808" Type="3">C-8</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109469">Under the government, the cost of a typical house has risen from $435,000 to $810,000. With inflation, purchasing power is down, not up, and wages are not keeping pace. Who can afford a house under this titanic disaster of a Liberal policy? Our economy has hit an iceberg and is sinking fast under the weight of 150 <I>Titanic</I> ships.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109470">We are told inflation will cost Canadians $2,000 each this year. We already know the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> does not shop for his own groceries, so he has not noticed the increases in prices on everything in the store. Bread, milk and other dairy products, meat and vegetables are all more expensive than they were this time last year. What is the government doing to address the concerns of Canadians concerned about their ability to afford nutritious food? It is doing absolutely nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109471">Rising prices and inflation are happening everywhere, they say. That is just an excuse for inaction. If the government does not understand how the economy works, if it cannot figure out how to help average Canadians in their time of need, maybe it should do the honourable thing, step aside and let someone else fix its problems, someone who will have Canadians' backs instead of stabbing those backs with high prices. That, of course, is not going to happen. The Liberals have no idea what a trillion dollars is, or how much 1.2 trillion loonies weigh. They do not seem to understand that there is a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="7109472">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has asked Canadians to forgive him for not thinking about monetary policy.

For years, Albertans felt there was an injustice in the way seats were apportioned in the House of Commons, until more seats were finally added in 2011 to allow fair representation for my home province. </ParaText><ParaText id="7068266">Canada has always been a place of competing interests, of give-and-take between provinces and regions. As a nation we have always tried to strike a balance, knowing that compromise is necessary but not always acceptable to everyone.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068267">In theory, we agree with the principle that each member of Parliament should represent a riding with a similar number of electors. It may not be a perfect system, but it allows constituencies to be more or less equal in population size and makes it possible for a member of Parliament to serve his or her constituents without being overwhelmed by the numbers. </ParaText><ParaText id="7068268">Of course, we do make allowances for history. No province can have fewer MPs than it does senators, and we have agreed that no province should have fewer MPs than it did in 1985. That explains why Prince Edward Island has four ridings with a population size of about 35,000 people each, while ridings in Nova Scotia are double that population. In Quebec, most of the ridings have more than 100,000 people, as do all the ridings in Alberta, except for one.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068269"> We have accepted this disparity in the name of national unity. The system has worked well on the whole, and, as I mentioned, the number of MPs was expanded in 2011 to allow for more representation in this House, especially for Alberta and Quebec. I have to wonder, therefore, why the government desires to change the rules once more. </ParaText><ParaText id="7068270">As population shifts, so do riding boundaries and representation in this House. That is something we all understand and accept, or maybe not all of us. Looking at the bill, I wonder what sort of precedent it sets and what sort of message it sends about democracy in Canada. How do those who are already feeling jaded about the state of our political system feel about the rules apparently once more not being applied fairly?</ParaText><ParaText id="7068271"> In any sports contest, the rules are agreed upon before the game starts. Both teams take to the field knowing what they must do in order to win. They do not pause midway to suggest rule changes because they have decided that the rules they started with were not good enough. I know that may be an imperfect analogy, but I am sure this proposal to redistribute seats and change the 1985 benchmark looks that way to many Canadians. Someone does not like the rules of the game, so they want to change them.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068272">The population of Canada is constantly shifting. Our cities are growing bigger. Some regions are attracting more immigrants than others. The reasons for demographic change are many, varied and complex. In this House we are tasked with finding a balance between competing needs or, more accurately, competing wants. The latest census data, as examined by Elections Canada, would see the addition of four more seats to this House to take into account the increase in our nation’s population. Given the increasing workload of members of Parliament, I doubt there is any member of this House who would disagree with the conclusion that more seats will enable MPs to better serve constituents.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="7068273">The problem is that under this impartial formula, Quebec would lose a seat in the House of Commons. Those from that province are understandably concerned that their influence will be lessened, though there would still be more MPs from Quebec than from the three prairie provinces combined and Quebec would still have more MPs than it did 20 years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068274">What are we to do here? We could guarantee that Quebec would always have the same number of seats it does now, which is the intent of this bill. There are those who believe it important to recognize the historical importance of Canada’s only francophone province. Would that be enough? What if the population of Quebec continues to shrink? This bill would amend the Constitution Act, 1867 to provide that when the number of seats in the House of Commons is redistributed after each decennial census, no province would have fewer seats than it had in the 43rd Parliament. At some future time, will we want to guarantee an even more uneven distribution of seats as a tribute to what once was? What will the 50th Parliament wish to address, or does our living democracy mean that this House will only tackle this question in the future?</ParaText><ParaText id="7068275">After all, the House of Commons is the people's chamber and should be representative of the population across the country. Conservatives respect the fundamental constitutional principle of representation by population that was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1991. However, we acknowledge that sometimes, as is proposed by this bill, there are other considerations, and deciding which considerations are more important is a difficult task.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068276">This bill reflects a motion that this House considered last month, which stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="7068277"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the House oppose any federal electoral redistribution scenario that would cause Quebec or any other province or territory to lose one or more electoral districts in the future, and that the House call on the government to act accordingly.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="7068278"> Coming from a province that will receive three more seats in the next redistribution and received additional seats from the last one, I understand the desire of members from an area of the country not blessed with Alberta’s growth to preserve what they have. The question we must ask and hopefully answer is this: Is this the wisest course to take? This Liberal bill preserves the redistribution formula created by the previous Conservative government’s 2011 Fair Representation Act, which added 30 new seats in the House of Commons. That was a huge jump in representation, much larger than the one about to be implemented, and perhaps set the stage for where we find ourselves today. Instead of giving a larger workload to members of Parliament and adding the resources necessary to do the extra work, this House chose to increase its size. How long can we continue to expand in this way?</ParaText><ParaText id="7068279"> The Liberal government has made many promises on electoral reform but has failed to even start an honest discussion on what this House should look like a decade or a century from now. We should be having a longer and deeper discussion on how we want to govern ourselves. Until we do, we will be passing this same act, with slight amendments, every decade or so. Is that the way we want to run a country?</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="216543" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-14, An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (electoral representation)</Term><Term Id="74273" IsProceduralTerm="0">Electoral representation</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="54406" IsProceduralTerm="0">Province of Quebec</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term><Term Id="40957" IsProceduralTerm="1">Splitting speaking time</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11700778" Hour="15" Minute="33"><Person><FirstName>Brad</FirstName><LastName>Vis</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11700929" Hour="15" Minute="42"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="11701046" EventId="11622505" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11622505/?ml=en" Sequence="322" Page="4204" PdfPage="54" TypeId="38" Date="2022-04-07" Hour="15" Minute="43" Second="57" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11701046" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Apr%20%207%202022%20%203:43PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11701046"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Preserving Provincial Representation in the House of Commons Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="11622505"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="7068282">Madam Speaker, this bill definitely carries on the legacy that started in 2011 under Prime Minister Harper, and that is what we see going through this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="7068283">I do not know what the member interpreted from my speech.

Unlike the famous actors, musicians and politicians of Arab descent whose names are well known, most of the entrepreneurs spend their careers outside of the public eye. Their contributions to Canadian society, though, are deep and long lasting.</ParaText><ParaText id="6998938">I too am an Arab, an immigrant, and my story is like that of many others. I came to Canada leaving behind a country that had suffered from 15 years of civil war. I had few memories of what life was like in a country at peace. I was looking for a new life. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998939">It was a beautiful snowy day on December 19, 1990, when I just arrived at the Edmonton International Airport, and I had never felt so cold, at -20°C, before. More than two dozen people were waiting to welcome me in the wonderful city of Edmonton, Alberta. The warmth of their reception made up for the chill in temperature. On the drive to the north side of Edmonton, with the white of the snow covering the fields and the roads, I felt peace and tranquility mixed with excitement. This was to be home.</ParaText><ParaText id="6998940">The next morning, I went outside and took a deeper breath of fresh cold air. It tasted of freedom and opportunity. There was something about this place that made me believe that the choice I made to immigrate from Lebanon to Canada was the right choice. Looking at the challenges ahead of me, I could see possibilities of success looming much larger than failure. I found my first job at a factory on the north side working as a labourer, packing furniture. A few months later I made a transition to the cost accounting department. I learned manufacturing first-hand, and realized how important this sector is to the Canadian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="6998941">Through that factory I made my way to the international market, exploring an opportunity to promote a made-in-Edmonton product in the Middle East. Only two months after becoming a Canadian citizen, I was once again on a plane, but this time as a proud Canadian exploring the Middle East to open markets for Canadian products, in a region where Canada is respected as a beacon of freedom, democracy and peace.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="6998942">As my horizons expanded, I began to understand what makes the economy grow and how opportunities could be found. Opening that Middle East market was a success story for a local manufacturing company and a professional milestone for this new immigrant.</ParaText><ParaText id="6998943">In Edmonton's Castle Downs community, I became involved with a group of volunteers, wanting to make a difference and give back to the community. I looked at politics and got to know the system, to better understand how to make our lives better and to help shape policies for the betterment of all. There I met wonderful, dedicated people who were passionate about service. I learned more and more about the local communities and became familiar with the different dynamics within our small world. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998944">As I said, my story is typical of so many Arabs who have come to this country to seek a better life and to give back to the community. I am proud of my heritage and am happy to see the establishment of Arab heritage month. I am prouder still to be a Canadian and to have been chosen by my fellow Canadians to represent them in the House of Commons. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998945">I would be remiss if I did not take time to sing the praises of the Arab language that is spoken by so many Canadians. It is the language of poetry and mysticism, law and humour. Just the sound of it is pleasing even to those who do not understand it. It is a language that unites people across the Middle East and north Africa. The rich literature that can be found in Arabic tells the story of many cultures united under a common banner. To me, that sounds like Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="6998946">The Arabs have always exported their culture. One can see the Arabic influence when one visits Spain's Andalusia region and sees the Arab influence in the architecture of the region. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998947">Who are the people we celebrate with this bill today? They are employees and employers, doctors and nurses, athletes, singers, actors and audiences. They come from all walks of life, from every strata of society, united by their heritage and a common identity as Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998948">Let us join together in the House and support this bill. Let us declare Arab heritage month, and let us celebrate the contributions of Arab Canadians to this great country. In making Canada their home, they have enriched us in too many ways to count. Let us make this, and every April, a celebration of a culture that has contributed so much to the richness of Canada. Let us honour those Arab Canadians who have contributed to making this country a multi-ethnic, multiracial mosaic where people live in peace and security. </ParaText><ParaText id="6998949">Canada is an example of what society can be when people celebrate their heritage without forgetting what unites them in common purpose. Let us celebrate Arab heritage month, and whoever we are and wherever we are from, we can all eat some baklava and shawarma at the end of the day.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="67435" IsProceduralTerm="0">Arab Canadians</Term><Term Id="214996" IsProceduralTerm="0">Arab Heritage Month</Term><Term Id="79852" IsProceduralTerm="0">Arabic</Term><Term Id="214985" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-232, An Act respecting Arab Heritage Month</Term><Term Id="38764" IsProceduralTerm="0">Culture and creativity</Term><Term Id="39064" IsProceduralTerm="0">Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs</Term><Term Id="39880" IsProceduralTerm="0">Literature and writing</Term><Term Id="40086" IsProceduralTerm="0">Multiculturalism</Term><Term Id="40497" IsProceduralTerm="1">Private Members' Bills</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11620875" Hour="17" Minute="35"><Person><FirstName>David</FirstName><LastName>McGuinty</LastName><Honorific>Hon.</Honorific><Constituency>Ottawa South</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11620793" Hour="17" Minute="45"><Person><FirstName>Luc</FirstName><LastName>Desilets</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="11607493" Title="Hansard - 37" TypeId="37" Date="2022-02-28" Time="11:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/037/HAN037-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="11606471" EventId="11544755" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11544755/?ml=en" Sequence="236" Page="2925" PdfPage="43" TypeId="38" Date="2022-02-28" Hour="15" Minute="22" Second="23" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11606471" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Feb%2028%202022%20%203:22PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11606471"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Government Orders</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Online Streaming Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="11544755"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="6991385">Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back here.

Very few remember that commission. The nature of broadcasting has changed in the past century. However, there were conclusions that are still important to remember today. The Aird report was a model of efficiency that we would do well to take note of today. It was only 13 pages long, plus a few appendices. There was only one page devoted to programming content, which is where it was noted that, “Every avenue should be vigorously explored to give Canadian listeners the best programs available from sources at home and abroad.”</ParaText><ParaText id="6991388">This flawed legislation, Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document> does nothing to provide Canadian listeners with the best programs. If anything, it discourages creative programming.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991389">Regulating programming made some sense in the 1930s, when the forerunner of the CRTC was created. Broadcasting then was limited to radio, and with a limited number of available frequencies, the government wanted to ensure a diversity of viewpoints and that Canadians had access to the airwaves.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991390">What did not make sense was the intertwinement of the regulator and the government-owned broadcaster created at the same time. Though the Liberals eventually realized that mistake, they continued to fail to understand the needs of Canadians and the nature of the dissemination of information in the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991391"> The government is picking up where it left off in the last Parliament and brings us a new bill to amend the Broadcasting Act. What it does not bring is new ideas, nor does it attempt to properly define what it means by “broadcasting”.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991392">According to Wikipedia, “Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model.”</ParaText><ParaText id="6991393">Britannica tells us:</ParaText><ParaText id="6991394"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Broadcasting, electronic transmission of radio and television signals that are intended for general public reception, as distinguished from private signals that are directed to specific receivers. In its most common form, broadcasting may be described as the systematic dissemination of entertainment, information, educational programming, and other features for simultaneous reception by a scattered audience with appropriate receiving apparatus.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="6991395">By definition, this bill is not about broadcasting. Instead, it is about extending the reach of the government in an attempt to control the Internet and free speech. It may be cloaked in technical language, amended in this paragraph here and that paragraph there, but there is no doubt, the intent is to limit the choices of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991396">We all know that the Internet bears no relation to traditional broadcasting. There is no frequency limitation online. The Internet is narrowcasting not broadcasting, as content creators can reach smaller segments of the population, which have not been served by traditional broadcasters.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991397">Canada is home to many world-class writers, actors, composers, musicians, artists and creators. They do not need government rules that would hold back their ability to be Canadian and to be global successes. Canadian content creators make most of their money, about 90%, outside Canada. Social media platforms are global, and Canadians are taking full advantage, both as creators of content and in enjoying what is available.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="6991398">Canadian social media stars do not want the government telling them what to do when it comes to their work as Canadians. When the Liberals claim that there is now an exemption for user-generated content, this legislation would allow the CRTC to regulate any content that generates revenue directly or indirectly, which means that virtually all content would still be regulated, including independent content creators earning a living on social media platforms such as YouTube and Spotify.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991399">What has upset the Liberals, and the reason they want to provide us with a new definition of broadcasting with this bill, is that they have lost control. Back in the pre-Internet days, the state controlled broadcasting. People needed a licence from the state in order to start a radio or television station and that could not be obtained unless they agreed to allow the state to control their content. With the Internet, the state has lost its ability to control. Each day, about 720,000 hours of content is uploaded in YouTube alone. The Liberals seem to find that offensive. They want to regulate it, to somehow bring the Internet under their control as broadcasting used to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991400">If this is simply a matter of the Liberals wanting a slice of the revenue pie to help offset their record deficits, there are easier methods than attacking all content creators. Instead of attempting to regulate the entire Internet, they could concentrate on large streaming services, perhaps those with half a million subscribers or more. Extracting money from streaming services to support Canadian content does not require the overreach the government is establishing.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991401"> Even with this, the government might want to think twice. Forcing streamers from outside Canada to contribute to the various Canadian talent development funds, for example, is full of risks. Fairness would say that if the government forces these entities to contribute to the fund, then it must also allow them to access the money that the fund is generating. Rather than creating a level playing field, such a move would harm Canada's traditional broadcasters, especially those whose Canadian content is primarily public affairs or sports programming. How would the limited amount they spend on drama compare with the amount spent by streaming services that specialize in dramatic programming? In that contest, would anyone still be watching CBC?</ParaText><ParaText id="6991402">Certainly, what this bill is not addressing is why we are regulating this. The Liberals, disturbing the free market, have never come across anything that they did not want to control, but just because they can introduce such legislation does not mean it is good legislation or that it should be passed. </ParaText><ParaText id="6991403">For 20 years, there have been calls for the government to redefine the Internet and broadcasting. Wise people resisted the argument, realizing that the Internet, in many ways, is a true example of the democratization of communications. Groups with limited or no access to traditional broadcasting, such as indigenous Canadians, now have unlimited access and the ability to tell their stories without government interference. The Liberals want that to end. </ParaText><ParaText id="6991404">There are perhaps 100,000 Canadians deriving all their income from their online activities. The government is not content with the income it is receiving from their taxes. It also wants to tell them what to create. It does not care if they have a relationship with their audience already.</ParaText><ParaText id="6991405">Our cultural industry is flourishing without government.

It must be voted down.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="38309" IsProceduralTerm="0">Broadcasting</Term><Term Id="214779" IsProceduralTerm="0">C-11, An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts</Term><Term Id="39372" IsProceduralTerm="1">Government bills</Term><Term Id="40816" IsProceduralTerm="1">Second reading</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11605966" Hour="15" Minute="36"><Person><FirstName>Kevin</FirstName><LastName>Lamoureux</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Winnipeg North</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11606159" Hour="15" Minute="37"><Person><FirstName>Rick</FirstName><LastName>Perkins</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>South Shore—St. Margarets</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem></PublicationItems></Publication><Publication Id="11595360" Title="Hansard - 36" TypeId="37" Date="2022-02-21" Time="7:00" Parliament="44" Session="1" Organization="House of Commons" PdfURL="/Content/House/441/Debates/036/HAN036-E.PDF" HtmlURL="" IsAudioOnly="0" IsTelevised="1" MeetingIsForSenateOrganization="0"><PublicationItems><PublicationItem Id="11596504" EventId="11538535" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11538535/?ml=en" Sequence="166" Page="2811" PdfPage="43" TypeId="38" Date="2022-02-21" Hour="11" Minute="45" Second="06" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11596504" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Feb%2021%202022%2011:45AM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11596504"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Orders of the Day</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Emergencies Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="11538535"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="6967440">Madam Speaker, history has taught us that giving any government or politician too much power or too much money leads to a dictatorship style of governance.

Today is supposed to be a day for Canadian families to celebrate and enjoy being a family, with all the peace and prosperity that they deserve. Meanwhile, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> chooses to be the sole architect of this crisis, which we have been talking about for the last few days.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967483">We stand at a crossroads in the House today. It is by this motion, and no other, that this Parliament, and the men and women in the House of Commons today, will be remembered. During the First World War, Canadians saw the War Measures Act imposed for the first time. Under that act, more than 8,500 men, women and children of Ukrainian background were interned in 24 camps across the country. Many of them had been born in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="6967484">Their rights, including the right to vote, were ignored by the government of the day, and Parliament and the people of Canada remained silent to those injustices. It was only in 2005, with the passage of the Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act, that some redress was made to the descendants of those who were abused by the government, acknowledging that what was done was wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967485">In early 1942, the government of Canada used the War Measures Act to intern more than 21,000 Japanese Canadians. They were held for the duration of the Second World War. Their homes and businesses were seized and sold to pay for the detention. Once again, Parliament and the people of Canada remained silent about the mistreatment of citizens. It was only in 1988 that the then prime minister Brian Mulroney apologized for this wrongful act by the Canadian government.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967486">The last time the War Measures Act was used was during the October Crisis of 1970. The government of the day imposed it because of a perceived insurrection, which turned out to be much less of an insurrection than the government had imagined. Hundreds of Quebeckers were ousted from their beds in the middle of the night and held without a trial, only to eventually be released without apology. Their supposed crime had been to show support for an unpopular idea, which was Quebec's independence. The government of the day lumped them together with those who had committed the crimes, unable to separate the difference between beliefs and actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967487">If that sounds much like what has happened in Canada over the past few weeks, that is because it is. The government does not seem able to grasp that it is possible to disagree with a policy and to protest against that policy without being dangerous to society, so it invoked the Emergencies Act. As former NDP leader Tommy Douglas famously remarked in 1970, it is like “using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut”. The government has failed to prove any justification for this action. In effect, it is using the most draconian piece of legislation at its disposal to fix a parking problem in downtown Ottawa.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967488">Members of the government ask us to trust them on this matter. They tell us that their actions will remain consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They tell us that there are no plans to call in the army. </ParaText><ParaText id="6967489">Pardon me for looking at the government's track record and taking those statements with a huge grain of salt. I am sure government members are sincere and believe what they are saying. Unfortunately, as we have seen, their actions are frequently quite different from the high ideals of their words, and it is by their actions that they will be judged, not by their flowery language.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="6967490">I would challenge any member from the government side to explain how freezing the bank accounts, without a warrant, of persons who have not been charged with a crime is consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Does the action apply only to those who have illegally parked their vehicles in downtown Ottawa? What about their families? Does it extend to those who have liked the “freedom convoy” on Facebook? How far will the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> go to silence those who disagree with his policies? We should just watch him. </ParaText><ParaText id="6967491">We have all heard stories about the government's no-fly list, which prevents thousands of people with alleged terrorist connections from air travel. We all agree that such a list had a purpose. However, that list of names is just that. It does not include passport numbers, dates of birth or other information to better identify those who may not fly. That means we regularly hear of those who are banned from air travel because their names are on the list, but they are not the ones who are targeted. A five-year-old child with the same name as a terrorist had no redress when turned away at the airport.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967492">Forgive me for wondering how we can trust the government to freeze the bank accounts of only those who have taken part in the Ottawa protest. It would be simple to arrest those on the scene. Instead, it is making it more complicated, and it is sure to make mistakes. Telling Canadians that the government respects the Charter of Rights will be cold comfort when it makes those mistakes and starts seizing the bank accounts of people who have no connection to the protests. Canadian citizens who have done nothing wrong will have the government seizing their assets, and they will have no redress.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967493">Government members will tell us that this could not happen. I ask members to remember the no-fly list and ask themselves if they believe it.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967494">Over the past week, I have received hundreds of phone calls, as I am sure is the case for every member in the House, not just from constituents, but also from other concerned Canadians. Some are angry at the state of our country. They do not understand why the federal government is not following the science in bringing an end to various mandates. They demand action.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967495">Many more, though, are afraid. They are afraid of the direction they see Canada taking. They see division in the House of Commons and in the country. Many blame the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for creating those divisions. Others blame politicians.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967496">One woman I spoke with, a senior citizen, was in tears. She loves Canada. She is horrified at what we are becoming. After two years of the pandemic, she feels helpless. She is looking to Parliament to show leadership, and what she sees is a government attempting to divide Canadians instead of unifying them, a government that denies the right to peaceful protest for anyone who disagrees with its policies, a prime minister who is too afraid of others' viewpoints to even meet with them on Zoom.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967497">I encourage all hon. members, as we cast our vote today, to consider their place in history, remember the abuses by governments past and ask ourselves if the situation at hand warrants the method being used by the government. Let us put aside our different political party identities and come together to vote as Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="6967498">The nation is watching us now. Will we pretend that we are living in 1917, 1942 or 1970, or will we show that we understand that, in 2022, Canadians must not be abused on a whim of a prime minister? History will remember our actions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></XmlContent><IndexEntries><Term Id="77058" IsProceduralTerm="0">Bank accounts</Term><Term Id="200792" IsProceduralTerm="0">COVID-19</Term><Term Id="39028" IsProceduralTerm="0">Emergencies</Term><Term Id="172387" IsProceduralTerm="0">Emergencies Act</Term><Term Id="67317" IsProceduralTerm="0">October Crisis</Term><Term Id="40278" IsProceduralTerm="0">Pandemic</Term><Term Id="56218" IsProceduralTerm="0">Protests</Term><Term Id="62222" IsProceduralTerm="0">Seizure of assets</Term><Term Id="54827" IsProceduralTerm="1">Statutory debates</Term><Term Id="67309" IsProceduralTerm="0">War Measures Act</Term></IndexEntries><PreviousPublicationItem Id="11596420" Hour="12" Minute="01"><Person><FirstName>Alexandra</FirstName><LastName>Mendès</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Brossard—Saint-Lambert</Constituency></Person></PreviousPublicationItem><NextPublicationItem Id="11596543" Hour="12" Minute="11"><Person><FirstName>Leah</FirstName><LastName>Taylor Roy</LastName><Honorific /><Constituency>Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</Constituency></Person></NextPublicationItem></PublicationItem><PublicationItem Id="11596544" EventId="11538570" VideoURL="//www.ourcommons.ca/Embed/en/i/11538570/?ml=en" Sequence="180" Page="2815" PdfPage="47" TypeId="38" Date="2022-02-21" Hour="12" Minute="12" Second="59" FacebookLink="?PubType=37&amp;Item=11596544" TwitterLink="http://twitter.com/share?text=Ziad%20Aboultaif%20%28Feb%2021%202022%2012:12PM%29:&amp;url=%20url%20?PubType=37%26Item=11596544"><Person Id="89156" IsMember="1"><ProfileUrl>//www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/89156</ProfileUrl><FirstName>Ziad</FirstName><LastName>Aboultaif</LastName><Honorific /><URLFullName>Ziad-Aboultaif</URLFullName><Constituency>Edmonton Manning</Constituency><Caucus Abbr="CPC">Conservative Caucus</Caucus><Province Code="AB">Alberta</Province><Image>//www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Parliamentarians/Images/OfficialMPPhotos/44/AboultaifZiad_CPC.jpg</Image></Person><OrderOfBusiness>Orders of the Day</OrderOfBusiness><SubjectOfBusiness>Emergencies Act</SubjectOfBusiness><EventType>Intervention</EventType><XmlContent><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" id="11538570"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="278569" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="6967502">Madam Speaker, the hon. member can call it by whatever name, at the end of the day, the action and the effect of it is what will be remembered by Canadians for generations to come.
