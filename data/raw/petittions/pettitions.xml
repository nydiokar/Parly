Given the worsening situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), as documented by the UN Commission of Inquiry in 2014, with many crimes against humanity likely occurring in the following human rights violations:</Para><Para>- Prioritization of food distribution to those considered useful to the survival of the current political system, while those deemed expendable face deprivation,</Para><Para>- A vast security apparatus that suppresses dissent through surveillance, coercion, fear, and punishment,</Para><Para>- Public executions and forced imprisonment of citizens in political prison camps, terrorizing the population into submission,</Para><Para>- State-sponsored abductions of citizens of other nations; and</Para><Para>2. Given that the People's Republic of China has disregarded or ignored recommendations from the UN Commission of Inquiry regarding North Korean defectors and other issues, including: </Para><Para>- Respecting the principle of non-refoulement,</Para><Para>- Allowing the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations full access to North Korean defectors,</Para><Para>- Adopting a victim-centric, human-rights-based approach to trafficking in persons,</Para><Para>- Regularizing the status of North Korean spouses and children of Chinese citizens to ensure their access to legal protections and rights, including birth registration and Chinese nationality,</Para><Para>- Raising concerns with North Korean authorities about abductions, forced repatriations, forced abortions, and infanticide targeting repatriated individuals. </Para><Para>Therefore, we, the undersigned citizens and residents, call on the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>1.

Engage actively with international organizations and foreign governments to press the PRC to allow safe passage for North Korean refugees to South Korea, where they are recognized as citizens; and</Para><Para>3. Establish initiatives to support the promotion of human rights in North Korea and aid defectors, without specifying a particular legislative structure. These measures should:</Para><Para>- Monitor and report on human rights issues in North Korea, including conditions in political prison camps and labour camps,</Para><Para>- Address the challenges facing North Korean defectors in China and other regions,</Para><Para>- Develop strategies for Canada to assist in protecting North Korean citizens from crimes against humanity and support their human rights and freedoms,</Para><Para>- Support international efforts to safeguard the people of North Korea from crimes against humanity and to promote political freedoms, including through dialogue with relevant organizations and governments.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><IndexEntries><Term Id="55663">Civil and human rights</Term><Term Id="39265">Foreign policy</Term><Term Id="57407">North Korea</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00149" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13593139" Title="451-00107 (Indigenous affairs)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="30"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>222</StatusId><StatusName>Presented to the House of Commons</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 24, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00107</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00107 (Indigenous affairs)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>September 24, 2025</PresentedDateTime><CertificationDateTime>September 24, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw attention to the House of Commons to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para>First Nations children off-reserve are no longer eligible to receive funding through Jordan's Principle at the federal level, as per the most recent operational bulletin which states, "Supports to school boards off-reserve and private schools will be redirected to provincial school boards, or other existing provincial and federally-funded programs."

He has broken a lot of promises. He promised to balance the budget, to reduce taxes on the middle class, and to build more affordable housing, but all those promises were broken;</li><li>So many hardworking young Canadians who are 35 living in their parent's basements. This never happened before this Prime Minister came along with his policies that doubled housing costs. Every month, 2,000 people line up at food banks. There are 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario. This has never been seen before. This is the type of thing we see in third world countries. People are dying in these encampments. Gun violence is up 120% since this Prime Minister went after hunters while letting criminals and gun smugglers go free;</li><li>It is time to axe the tax to make work pay off again, so that servers, truck drivers and plumbers who work more earn more and bring home powerful paycheques. For that to happen, though, people need a roof over their heads. Currently, Canada has fewer homes per capita than any other G7 country. There is too much red tape. We must incentivize municipalities to speed up building permits, cut building taxes and free up land for building, while axing the tax that stands in the way of construction, so that young people still have a chance of getting a home. We must cap population growth so that the housing stock grows faster than the population; and</li><li>We must fix the budget with a law that requires the government to find one dollar of savings for every new dollar of spending. This is how parents, seniors and small businesses balance their budgets, and they expect us to adopt the same common-sense approach. We must cut the use of consultants. We must cut bureaucracy, waste and big handouts to multinational corporations that are offshoring our money. We must cut all that to bring the money home so we can lower deficits, inflation and interest rates and fund our social services. We must stop the crime not by banning hunting rifles but by being tough on criminals and strengthening the border. By doing this, Canada can bring home a country where hard work earns a more powerful paycheque that buys affordable food, gas and homes in safe communities, where anyone from anywhere can do anything through hard work. That is the promise of Canada, and that is what we must bring home.</li></ul></Para><Para>Therefore we, the undersigned citizens and residents, call on the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>Axe the tax. Build Homes. Fix the Budget. Stop the Crime. Call an immediate carbon tax election so that Canadians can judge the government for its many failures and replace the government with a new common sense conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><IndexEntries><Term Id="38333">Budgetary policy</Term><Term Id="38425">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="38741">Crime prevention</Term><Term Id="39593">Housing</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00018" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13543557" Title="451-00077 (Justice)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="38"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>222</StatusId><StatusName>Presented to the House of Commons</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 16, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00077</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00077 (Justice)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>September 16, 2025</PresentedDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 3, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons</Title><Prayer><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Choosing medical assistance in dying (MAID) due to lack of available services or treatments is not a real choice;</li><li>Allowing medical assistance in dying for those with disabilities or chronic illness who are not dying devalues their lives, tacitly endorsing the notion that life with disability is optional, and by extension, dispensable;</li><li>Offering medical assistance in dying as a "solution" for disability or chronic illness reduces incentives to improve treatment and care for people with these conditions;</li><li>Canadians do not want an ableist healthcare system where the lives of those with disabilities are seen as not worth living;</li><li>Many disability advocates in Canada have expressed opposition to allowing MAID for people with disabilities.</li></ul></Para><Para>Therefore we, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:<ul type="disc"><li>Protect all Canadians whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable by prohibiting medical assistance in dying for those whose prognosis for natural death is more than six months.</li></ul></Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><IndexEntries><Term Id="87707">Medical assistance in dying</Term><Term Id="38871">Persons with disabilities</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00106" /><Petition Number="451-00125" /><Petition Number="451-00141" /><Petition Number="451-00148" /><Petition Number="451-00109" /><Petition Number="451-00163" /><Petition Number="451-00155" /><Petition Number="451-00160" /><Petition Number="451-00165" /><Petition Number="451-00021" /><Petition Number="451-00017" /><Petition Number="451-00016" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13199949" Title="451-00076 (Health)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="40"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>222</StatusId><StatusName>Presented to the House of Commons</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 16, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00076</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00076 (Health)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>September 16, 2025</PresentedDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 14, 2024</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons in Parliament Assembled</Title><Prayer><Para>WE, THE UNDERSIGNED RESIDENTS OF CANADA, draw the attention of the House to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas sexually explicit material -

The amount of benefits payable is generally based on how much and how long an individual contributed to the CPP.  </para><para>OAS and CPP benefits were never intended to meet all the retirement income needs of seniors.  Rather, together, they provide a stable base upon which individuals can add income from private third pillar measures, such as employer-sponsored pension plans, registered retirement savings plans, tax-free savings accounts or other personal savings and investments, to address their and their family’s anticipated financial needs.  </para><para>The Government of Canada is firmly committed to maintaining a strong and stable public pension system for the financial security of Canadians.  The rules governing the CPP strive to strike a balance between the long-term sustainability of the Plan, and fairness and flexibility for individuals in their retirement and for those who may qualify for supplementary benefits under the CPP such as monthly survivor’s pensions. </para><para>In the event of the death of a contributor, the CPP provides income support through three survivor benefits.  These include: (a) the lump-sum death benefit of $2,500, generally payable to the estate of the deceased, and intended to help offset funeral expenses; (b) monthly flat-rate children’s benefits payable to dependent children under the age of 18, or under the age of 25 if the children remain in school; and, (c) the monthly survivor’s pension payable to the spouse or common-law partner of the deceased.  In order to leave behind survivor benefits, the deceased must have contributed to the CPP for ten (10) years, or for at least one-third of the total number of years in their contributory period, but never less than three (3) years.  </para><para>The intent of the CPP’s monthly survivor’s pension is to help compensate for the loss of household earnings resulting from the death of a spouse or common-law partner.  As with all CPP supplementary benefits, the survivor’s pension reflects the social insurance nature of the Plan and is not a direct return on contributions made by the deceased. The amount of the pension is primarily based on the earnings and contributions of the deceased, however, it is also affected by the age of the surviving partner.  Survivors aged 65 or older receive a pension equal to 60% of the retirement pension of the deceased contributor, without any adjustment based on the deceased contributor’s age.  That is to say, the amount of retirement pension as if they began collecting it at age 65.  Younger survivors who are not yet eligible for other senior’s benefits, including the Old Age Security pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement, instead receive a pension that consists of two parts: a flat-rate component (equal to $233.50 in 2025), and an earnings-related component equal to 37.5% of the deceased partner’s CPP retirement pension.  </para><para>As reflected in this petition, there are specific rules for combining CPP benefits.  Specifically, when a person receiving a CPP survivor’s pension becomes eligible for their own retirement pension, or vice versa, a combined benefit calculation applies. Under these rules, the amount of the survivor’s pension is reduced by 40% of the smaller of the two pensions (retirement or survivor).  Additionally, the base component of the combined benefit (that is to say, the original component that pre-dates the CPP enhancement) cannot exceed the maximum base component of the CPP retirement pension ($1,387.08 per month in 2025).  These calculations – that is to say, the reduction and the limit – are performed before the actuarial adjustment is applied to the survivor’s retirement pension – ensuring that a survivor’s pension paid to an individual who chose to delay the start of their retirement pension is not penalized.  In cases where the survivor began collecting their retirement pension before the age of 65, the combined benefit formula also reduces how much of their retirement pension is subject to the actuarial reduction for early retirement.      </para><para>The limit on combined benefits has been a feature of the CPP since its inception in 1966 and reflects the original design principle that no single individual should receive a CPP pension, or combination of pensions, that is greater than the amount that would be paid to an individual contributor who worked and made the maximum contributions to the CPP possible throughout their working life.  Focusing survivor’s pensions on individuals with smaller retirement pensions in this way is a limit on the social insurance provided under the Plan and serves to strike a balance between providing support to those households most in need, and the affordability of the protection that is provided reflected in the contribution rate that all workers and employers pay. </para><para>The limit on combined benefits does not, however, apply to the enhanced component of the CPP, as this newer part of the Plan was designed to have a closer link between contributions and benefits, and to reflect the modern realities of Canadians.  The CPP enhancement works as a “top-up” to the base, or original, component of the CPP, and increases the benefits of individuals who work and contribute in 2019 or later.  The enhanced component of benefits will grow slowly over time as Canadians work and make contributions to the enhancement, with 40 years of enhanced contributions required to receive the full effect of the CPP enhancement – which will, in time, increase the maximum retirement and survivor’s pensions by more than 50%.  Given that the enhancement is less than 10 years old, the additional amounts provided to combined beneficiaries in 2025 remain relatively small, however, its share will grow in significance as individuals work and continue contributing to the enhanced CPP over time.   </para><para>As the CPP is self-funded, increasing benefits – such as by implementing this change – would put pressure on the Plan’s finances, and would likely require an increase in the contribution rates paid by all workers in Canada and their employers.  In addition, as a result of the reforms that restored the long-term financial health to the Plan in the 1990s, there is also a legal requirement that any change to the CPP that would increase or add new benefits be fully funded, and paid for by the generation that will receive them.  This requirement was put in place to reflect one of the key principles of the CPP: which to ensure fairness and equity across generations. </para><para>Responsibility for the CPP is shared with the provinces, reflecting the constitutional division of powers, and as a result, the Government of Canada is unable to unilaterally modify the CPP to allow a survivor to receive an unreduced pension, as proposed in the petition.   Major changes to the Plan, such as those that would modify benefits, require not only an act of Parliament, but also the formal approval of two-thirds of provinces representing two-thirds of the population.  </para><para>The Government thanks the undersigned for their important contributions and inputs on this issue and will take their requests under further consideration as federal and provincial governments explore ways to further meet the needs of survivors and all Canadians moving forward under the CPP.    </para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="58339">Surviving spouses</Term><Term Id="41051">Survivor

With respect to achievements to date on the Kitchener GO Rail line, we understand from Ontario that a number of key milestones both within and beyond the scope of federally funded works have been reached, including completion of the Highway 401/409 Rail Tunnel, completion of construction work at Bramalea GO Station, installation of a new passing track at Breslau, and construction of a new second platform at Guelph Central GO Station. In addition, Ontario is currently in the design phase of the On-Corridor Works project, which is the largest and most critical element of the Program. The On-Corridor Works project includes a broad scope of work such as track, civil infrastructure, signaling, electrification infrastructure and vehicles, as well as operations and maintenance of the entire GO rail network. </para><para>In April 2022, Ontario announced the selection of ONxpress Transportation Partners as the delivery partner for the On-Corridor Works project and that they had entered into a design phase contract with the goal of refining the costing and schedule of the works to be delivered. As stated when announcing the selection of ONxpress, once the design phase is complete, the Province of Ontario will provide an update on the cost and schedule for the Program and its works. In the interim, Metrolinx, Ontario’s transit agency for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, regularly publishes community engagement updates on its website for the Program.</para><para>It should be noted that the segment of track between Union Station and Bramalea GO Station is owned by Ontario which facilitates upgrades to the announced service levels and scheduling of GO Trains on this segment. Conversely, the track between Bramalea and Georgetown stations is owned by the Canadian National Railway Company (CN), which prioritizes its commercial trains on this segment and Metrolinx is required to negotiate access for GO Trains. In order to achieve two-way all-day service, GO Expansion will construct three passing tracks between Georgetown and Kitchener, including the tracks installed in Breslau; however, the restrictions imposed by the use of Canadian National Railway Company’s mainline between Bramalea and Georgetown may have impacts.</para><para>As with all projects funded through Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada’s programs, the Government of Canada is solely a funder of the works under the federal agreement for the Project and is not involved in the planning, decision-making, or implementation of the Project or the broader Program undertaken by the Province of Ontario. As such, Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada does not set the scope of work or the construction schedule for the federally funded Project nor the provincial GO Expansion Program more broadly.</para><para>In order to ensure success of the Project, departmental officials engage regularly with officials from the Ministry of Transportation Ontario and Metrolinx to monitor the progress of the Project through Oversight Committee meetings and other engagement as necessary. This engagement will continue until the federally funded scope of the GO Expansion Program has been completed, including third-party certification, to Canada’s satisfaction.</para><para>The GO Expansion Program is a $16.8 billion investment by the Province of Ontario that will transform service across seven existing GO Rail lines from rush hour commuter service to two-way all-day service, providing expanded mobility options to residents and capacity to meet future demands across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. </para><para>It is important to note that while the federally funded GO Expansion Project contributes to the success of the Province’s GO Expansion Program, it is only a portion of the overall work necessary to achieve that broader goal. Specifically, the federal funding for the Project supports primarily early and enabling works such as grading, utility relocations, grade separations, installation of new tracks, and upgrading existing stations. The overall GO Expansion Program includes significant additional works that are outside the scope of federal funding, yet are necessary to enable the Program’s goals, such as electrification of the Metrolinx owned corridors, including on the Kitchener Line from Union to Bramalea Station.</para><para>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring the successful completion of crucial public transit infrastructure projects. Together with provincial, municipal partners and transit authorities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, we will work to ensure that infrastructure investments promote economic growth and improve our quality of life, including through the delivery of housing outcomes, for all Canadians. </para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="37986">Accountability</Term><Term Id="161515">GO Transit</Term><Term Id="195927">High-frequency rail</Term><Term Id="53759">Kitchener</Term><Term Id="40557">Public transit</Term></IndexEntries></Petition><Petition Id="13560073" Title="451-00045 (Social affairs and equality)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="26"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 15, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00045</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00045 (Social affairs and equality)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Jamil</FirstName><LastName>Jivani</LastName><Constituency>Bowmanville—Oshawa North</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 16, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>September 15, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 13, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned, citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the Government of Canada to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas Many Christians in Canada are concerned about government and corporate overreach in their communities, workplaces or schools.</Para><Para>Whereas Anti-Christian bigotry and discrimination also affects Christian citizens and organizations in our country.</Para><Para>Whereas All levels of government must take action to protect Christians in Canada.</Para><Para>Therefore, we, the undersigned, citizens, and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>1.

The Government of Canada recognizes parents’ primary responsibility to support their children in line with the child’s best interests and in accordance with Canadian and international law, including the UN <i>Convention on the Rights of the Child.</i></para><para>Education falls primarily under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, while the federal government oversees education for children on First Nations reserves or Crown lands. Public school systems are governed by provincial or territorial legislation and administered by elected school boards.</para><para>Family law, a shared responsibility between federal and provincial governments, also recognizes parental responsibilities for education and religion. The <i>Divorce Act</i> requires courts to consider a child's cultural, linguistic, religious, and spiritual upbringing when making parenting decisions, recognizing the importance of cultural identity and self-esteem in a child’s development.</para><para>Part 2</para><para>The Government of Canada respects freedom of conscience and religion. This freedom is guaranteed by section 2(a) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> (Charter) - part of the Constitution of Canada - and subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.</para><para>The regulation of health care professionals is generally a matter within provincial or territorial, rather than federal, jurisdiction. The Charter applies to provincial and territorial governments and any measures that they implement affecting the conscience and religious rights of health care professionals.</para><para>Part 3</para><para>The criminal justice system is a shared responsibility. The federal government enacts criminal laws, including those prohibiting hate and harmful conduct, while provinces handle their administration, such as investigation and prosecution. The Government of Canada is committed to working with provincial and territorial partners to respond effectively to hate-motivated crimes, including those targeting churches and other places of worship.</para><para>Regardless of motive, it is unacceptable for anyone in Canada to be blocked, intimidated or harassed when accessing religious and other vulnerable institutions, such as schools. This is why the <i>Criminal Code</i> contains offences of general application that prohibit this harmful conduct against all persons and property, including when it occurs at a church or other places of worship. Some of these offences include criminal harassment (section 264), uttering threats (section 264.1), all forms of assault (sections 266-268), intimidation (section 423), and mischief to property/obstruction (section 430). It also includes specific protections for properties primarily used for religious worship or by identifiable groups (e.g. based on race, religion, gender, disability, etc.) in certain circumstances. Finally, the <i>Criminal Code</i> also requires judges to consider evidence that any offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate as an aggravating factor at sentencing (paragraph 718.2(a)(i)).</para><para>Part 4</para><para>The Government of Canada recognizes the vital role that charities, including religious charities, play in delivering essential services to some of the most vulnerable in Canadian society. To support their important work, registered charities are granted significant tax benefits and privileges, including the ability to issue official donation receipts for the gifts they receive.</para><para>Under the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, an organization may qualify for charitable registration only if it is established exclusively for charitable purposes and devotes all its resources to achieving those purposes.

The RCMP and police across Canada are committed to continuing their engagement with religious communities, leaders, and places of worship, providing additional security presence as required. The RCMP is also demonstrating leadership in this space by facilitating information sharing and best practice exchanges between police of jurisdiction, as well as developing guidance material and new training courses to help enhance police understanding and response to hate crimes and incidents. Canadians of all faiths and religious backgrounds are encouraged to engage with their police of jurisdiction if they feel unsafe and to access Public Safety’s Canada Community Security Program, which provides vital support to communities at risk of hate-motivated crime by helping to enhance the security of community gathering spaces, including places of worship. From 2016 to 2024, Public Safety Canada provided $2.5 million to enhance security measures at 92 churches.</para><para> </para><para>The criminal justice system is a matter of shared responsibility. The federal government is responsible for the enactment of criminal law, including the enactment of offences that prohibit hateful and other harmful conduct. The provincial government is responsible for the administration of justice, which includes the investigation and prosecution of most Criminal Code offences. Our government remains committed to working with provincial and territorial partners to ensure a coordinated and effective response to hate-motivated and other crimes which target churches and other places of worship.</para><para> </para><para>Whether motivated by hate or not, it is also unacceptable that people in Canada are blocked, intimidated or harassed when accessing religious and other vulnerable institutions, such as schools. This is why the Criminal Code contains offences of general application that prohibit this harmful conduct against all persons and property, including when it occurs at a church or other places of worship. Some of these offences include criminal harassment (section 264), uttering threats (section 264.1), all forms of assault (sections 266-268), intimidation (section 423), and mischief to property/obstruction (section 430). In addition, there is also the offence of mischief motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, to property that is primarily used for religious worship or to property that is primarily used by an “identifiable group” for certain purposes, including as an educational institution or senior residence (subsection 430(4.1)). An “Identifiable group” refers to any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or mental or physical disability. Finally, the Criminal Code also requires judges to consider evidence that any offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate as an aggravating factor at sentencing (paragraph 718.2(a)(i)).</para><para>Our government believes that Canada has a robust criminal law framework to deal with this hate-motivated and harmful conduct, and remains open to exploring other ways to ensure that our criminal laws adequately and effectively address these issues.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="65320">Christianity and Christians</Term><Term Id="40656">Freedom of conscience and religion</Term><Term Id="40652">Religious discrimination</Term></IndexEntries></Petition><Petition Id="12830415" Title="451-00042 (Correctional system)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="53"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 15, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00042</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00042 (Correctional system)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Brad</FirstName><LastName>Vis</LastName><Constituency>Mission—Matsqui—Abbotsford</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>BC</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 16, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>September 15, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>January 23, 2024</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada </Title><Prayer><Para>WHEREAS:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>At the direction of the Liberal government, the Correctional Service of Canada is operating the Prison Needle Exchange Program (PNEP) in federal correctional institutions, effectively encouraging illicit drugs use in prisons;</li><li>Illicit drugs in federal institutions are contraband.

CSC views individual substance use first and foremost as a health concern, and has implemented a range of prevention, treatment, and harm reduction measures, in line with the Canadian Drug and Substances Strategy, to work with incarcerated offenders in response to this need and to help prevent lethal overdoses. Of note, there have been no reported fatalities involving participants using our harm reduction services.</para><para>CSC began implementing a Prison Needle Exchange Program (PNEP) to prevent the sharing of needles, facilitate referrals to health care services and programs, and limit the spread of infectious diseases, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/AIDS and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in federal institutions. It is important to note that this is just one measure that is available to incarcerated offenders and complements other existing measures.</para><para>Before an individual can participate in the PNEP program, CSC completes a Threat Risk Assessment (TRA), to confirm that it is suitable to allow the individual to possess a needle, similar to the one currently being used for Epipens and needles for insulin use. As of June 16, 2025, there have been no reported assaults on employees or incarcerated offenders involving needles used in the PNEP program.</para><para>The safety and security of institutions, staff, offenders, and the public is a top priority. Preventing the introduction of contraband and reducing the use of illicit substances by incarcerated offenders in correctional institutions remains an ongoing key priority as they pose a risk to the safety and security of our institutions and impact offender rehabilitation. CSC works closely with local police agencies and communities to prevent and reduce contraband and unauthorized items, including drugs and substances, from entering institutions. Illicit drugs are considered contraband in federal institutions, and inmates found to be in possession of or dealing in, illicit drugs may be subject to administrative consequences, disciplinary charges/sanctions, and/or criminal charges.</para><para>CSC has a National Drug Strategy, which incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to review and address an incarcerated individual’s substance use. Aligned with Commissioner’s Directive 585 National Drug Strategy, each institution has developed and implemented drug strategies to balance detection, deterrence, and treatment. As part of this, and to support the safety and security of everyone in our institutions, CSC continues to implement measures to address the introduction, trafficking, financing, and/or distribution of contraband within our institutions. The elements of the National Drug Strategy include:</para><para>Increasing the awareness of the negative consequences of illicit drug use - This component focuses on preventing illicit drug use by offenders in institutions. This is accomplished by providing awareness programs, infectious disease testing and associated treatment, and Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT). It also involves delivering quality health services to incarcerated offenders to assist them in achieving a drug-free lifestyle.</para><para>Reducing the demand for illicit drugs - CSC focuses on reducing the demand for illicit drugs by supporting innovative and effective approaches to intervening with, treating and rehabilitating offenders who use illicit drugs. CSC offers a suite of health interventions and correctional programming that addresses multiple criminogenic needs, including substance use disorder. Correctional programs are offered at intensity levels that are commensurate to the offenders’ risk level.</para><para>Reducing the supply of illicit drugs - CSC focuses on reducing and preventing the supply of illicit drugs through various efforts to investigate and disrupt the introduction and trafficking of contraband in our institutions. CSC also continues to lead intelligence investigations relating to the introduction and trafficking of contraband and strengthen partnerships with police to pursue criminal investigations into drug traffickers targeting our facilities.</para><para>Strict policies concerning contraband and unauthorized activities are in place, which are enforced through dynamic and static security practices, including extensive search procedures for offenders, staff, and visitors. Incarcerated individuals found to be in possession of or dealing in, illicit drugs can face administrative consequences, disciplinary sanctions, and/or criminal charges.</para><para>In addition to staff vigilance, dynamic security and security intelligence information, CSC relies on a combination of detection equipment, search practices and a variety of approved techniques to prevent the entry of drugs and contraband. This includes interdiction measures such as routine searches of persons (including inmates, visitors and staff), vehicles, cells/rooms, and other areas of the institution, which are in accordance with the Institutional Search Plan as well as non-routine searches, which may be authorized based on staff observations and intelligence information. Other measures include regular monitoring of offender activity; random urinalysis testing; and the non-intrusive searching of all visitors entering institutions using tools such as metal detectors, ion scanners, and detector dogs.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="38707">Correctional facilities</Term><Term Id="38934">Drug use and abuse</Term><Term Id="75268">Needle exchange program</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="441-02934" /><Petition Number="451-00062" /><Petition Number="441-02569" /><Petition Number="441-02240" /><Petition Number="441-02808" /><Petition Number="441-02452" /><Petition Number="441-02138" /><Petition Number="441-02223" /><Petition Number="441-02185" /><Petition Number="441-02091" /><Petition Number="441-02175" /><Petition Number="441-02049" /><Petition Number="441-02502" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13546207" Title="451-00039 (Employment and labour)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="26"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 15, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00039</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00039 (Employment and labour)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Jamil</FirstName><LastName>Jivani</LastName><Constituency>Bowmanville—Oshawa North</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 12, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>September 15, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 6, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada</Title><Prayer><Para>The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) is a large contributor to Canada's immigration system getting out of control with unsustainable immigration levels.

Temporary foreign workers hired through the TFW Program accounted for approximately 1% of the total Canadian labour market, and approximately 8% of non-permanent resident volumes in 2024.<b />These workers play a crucial role in key sectors that face serious labour shortages, including agriculture, food processing, construction, and tourism. In particular, approximately 96,000 temporary foreign workers had a valid work permit in 2024 within the Primary Agriculture stream. </para><para>To protect the Canadian labour market, the TFW Program requires employers to submit a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to the Government of Canada prior to being permitted to hire a foreign national.</para><para>The LMIA evaluates whether there is valid justification and a genuine need for the employer to hire a temporary foreign worker, including labour market information confirming the presence of a labour shortage and impacts on the local labour market, while also imposing specific requirements. For instance, employers are generally required to demonstrate that they have made efforts to recruit Canadians and permanent residents before applying. This includes a requirement to advertise on Job Bank or its provincial counterpart, and, for low-wage positions, demonstrate that efforts have been made to recruit from at least two underrepresented employment groups (e.g., Indigenous persons, vulnerable youth, newcomers, persons with disabilities, and asylum seekers with a valid work permit). </para><para>With respect to ensuring that an appropriate wage is being offered, employers applying for an LMIA must pay a temporary foreign worker, at minimum, the prevailing wage for the occupation and work location where the requested worker will be employed. Effective January 1, 2024, to better support workers and address concerns of wage suppression, employers of temporary foreign workers are required to annually review temporary foreign workers’ wages to ensure that they reflect increases to prevailing wage rates for their given occupation and region of work. Through periodic wage increases, these reviews help to ensure that employers continue to pay temporary foreign workers at the prevailing wage level throughout their period of employment. Employers who do not update wages accordingly may be subject to administrative monetary penalties and bans from using the Program.</para><para>The Government of Canada continues to actively monitor labour market conditions to ensure that the TFW Program responds to current economic needs, and that Canadians and permanent residents are considered first for job opportunities.</para><ul><li>Recognizing the changing labour market, the Government of Canada implemented a series of program changes in the fall of 2024 to ensure that the TFW Program is used responsibly and to reduce the reliance of Canadian employers on temporary foreign workers. </li><li>These measures included: A “Refusal to Process” policy for LMIA applications in the low-wage stream in census metropolitan areas with unemployment rates of 6% or higher, with exceptions for critical sectors such as food manufacturing, construction, and healthcare.</li><li>A 10% cap on the proportion of temporary foreign workers in low-wage positions an employer can hire at a given work location.</li><li>A reduction in the maximum employment duration for low-wage temporary foreign workers from two years to one year.</li><li>A 20% increase in the wage threshold used to determine whether a position falls under the low- or high-wage stream, ensuring more positions are subject to stricter requirements.</li><li>Stricter documentation requirements for employer legitimacy and enhanced oversight in high-risk sectors.</li></ul><para>However, exemptions were granted for positions in the agriculture and agri-food sectors that contribute to protecting Canadian food security and intended to help address labour shortages in these sectors, which are particularly severe during seasonal peaks.</para><para>The TFW Program continues to work closely with provinces, territories, and stakeholders to ensure that the Program complements Canada’s labour market needs without displacing domestic workers.

Fostering greater engagement and closer ties with countries through trade agreements allows Canada to promote Canadian values, such as human rights, democracy, openness, respect for the rule of law, and rules-based international trade.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="55663">Civil and human rights</Term><Term Id="55810">India</Term><Term Id="39742">International trade</Term><Term Id="40655">Religious minorities</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="441-01682" /><Petition Number="441-01691" /><Petition Number="441-01782" /><Petition Number="441-02505" /><Petition Number="441-02916" /><Petition Number="441-01760" /><Petition Number="441-02779" /><Petition Number="441-01608" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="12988999" Title="451-00022 (Foreign affairs)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="29"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>September 15, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00022</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00022 (Foreign affairs)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 5, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>September 15, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>April 5, 2024</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>The current Canadian government is aware of the crimes against humanity by the Venezuelan government and has created a Family based Humanitarian program for Colombian, Haitians and Venezuelans suffering under current country conditions;</li><li>Canada has been one of the six countries that submitted Venezuela to the International Criminal Court denouncing crimes against humanity as defined by the Roma Statute.

The four crimes are political persecution, forced disappearance, sexual abuse and systematic torture. The preliminary examination is ongoing;</li><li>Several international organizations, including Canadian NGO Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights (RWCHR), led by former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, have recognized the unjust incarcerations, torture, forced disappearance and political persecution of 257 individuals, including 146 military personnel.

Venezuelan agents conducted a violent search inside Igbert and Oswaldo's confinement places on Dec 20, 2023, leaving them naked and removing all their personal belongings, including books, family photos and medications.

We are aware of numerous cases of mistreatment, including the detention and violent search inside Igbert Jose Marin Chaparro and Oswaldo Valentin Garcia Palomo’s places of confinement.</para><para>Canada will continue to denounce the severe human rights abuses and acts of violence that have followed the July 28, 2024, presidential election, as well as the May 25, 2025, legislative and regional elections, and demands the immediate release of individuals who have been arbitrarily arrested, imprisoned or detained. Canada works with the international community to hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations and crimes against humanity. We believe that international accountability mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court, play a critical role in addressing these grave injustices. Canada’s position is in line with its longstanding advocacy for the restoration of civil and political rights in Venezuela, including restrictions on civic space and the protection of human rights defenders.</para><para>Canada advocates within multilateral institutions for the restoration of civil and political rights in Venezuela, including those arbitrarily detained. For example, Canada led the renewal of the mandates of the Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor and promote human rights in Venezuela in 2024.  </para><para>In recent months, Canada increased sanctions, with 139 individuals now sanctioned under the <i>Special Economic Measures Act</i> and the <i>Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act.</i> These sanctions focus on individuals involved in gross human rights violations, acts undermining democratic institutions, and/or significant acts of corruption. Currently, such sanctions include travel and dealings bans.</para><para>Canada has not recognized the <i>de facto</i> authorities in Venezuela as that country’s legitimate government since the 2018 elections.

When foreign nationals seek entry to Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada works closely with Canada Border Services Agency and other security partners to screen applicants, on a case by case basis, to determine whether they are admissible to enter and/or remain in Canada. Security screening is an important part of the overall assessment of whether a person is admissible to Canada. If an individual is determined to be inadmissible, they may be denied a visa and entry to Canada. Inadmissible individuals who are already in Canada may be removed from Canada.</para><para>Under our immigration law, an individual can be found inadmissible for security reasons, including espionage; subversion (for example, attempts to overthrow a government); terrorism; or membership in an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe they are engaged, have engaged or will engage in any of these activities. They are also inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for committing a crime against humanity or war crime outside Canada or being a prescribed senior official in a government that, in the opinion of the Minister, engages or has engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations, or genocide, a war crime or a crime against humanity.</para><para>Additionally, under the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</i>, foreign nationals who have committed or who are convicted of a crime outside Canada may be inadmissible to Canada. All past criminal history is considered. Immigration officers examine foreign charges, convictions, and evidence of criminal activity to determine if there is an equivalent offence in Canada for the act committed. If there is an equivalent offence, the individual would be inadmissible for having committed or being convicted for that offence.</para><para>Canada offers refugee protection (asylum) to individuals in Canada who have a well-founded fear of persecution or who may face a:</para><ul><li>danger of torture</li><li>risk to their life</li><li>risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment</li></ul><para>If individuals feel they could face one of these risks if they go back to their home country, or, if individuals are stateless, unable to return the country where they normally live, they may be able to seek protection in Canada as a refugee.</para><para>The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) hears individual claims for refugee status from claimants within Canada.

At the Human Rights Council, Canada regularly calls upon Eritrea to improve the human rights situation in the country. Canada actively participates in the negotiations and traditionally co-sponsors, most recently in 2025, the resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Eritrea", which renews the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea.</para><para>In March 2023 during the Human Rights Council’s General Debate, Canada raised the issue of restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and arbitrary detention in Eritrea, and continues to monitor the cases of imprisoned journalists, political activists, and members of religious groups. Canadian officials met with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea during his October 2023 visit to Canada to discuss the dire human rights situation and his mandate. In May 2024, Canada reiterated its concerns during Eritrea’s appearance before the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review.</para><para>Canada has also repeatedly and publicly called for the swift withdrawal of Eritrean forces from northern Ethiopia, including through public joint statements with likeminded countries, as done on November 2, 2023, in the Joint Statement on the <i>One Year Anniversary of the Pretoria Cessation of Hostilities Agreement</i>. On September 22, 2022, officials of the Government of Canada spoke at the Human Rights Council and urged all parties to cease violence immediately, respect human rights and implement accountability measures, and called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean Defense Forces.</para><para>Canada’s former Ambassador to Sudan, who was also responsible for Eritrea, engaged with Eritrean officials in 2021, calling on them to withdraw Eritrean Defense Forces from northern Ethiopia. On September 20, 2022, a tweet issued from the Global Affairs Canada corporate account deplored the movement of Eritrean Defense Forces in northern Ethiopia and condemned the escalation of hostilities.</para><para>Sanctions are an important complement to Canada’s foreign policy tools, which include dialogue, capacity building, advocacy, multilateral engagement, and other diplomatic actions. Canada reviews all of its policy options continuously and tailors its responses to the specifics of each unique situation. Canada is judicious in its approach to imposing sanctions and is committed to their effective and coordinated use when appropriate. To that end, Canada has established a rigorous due diligence process to consider and evaluate possible cases of human rights violations, corruption or other circumstances that may warrant the use of sanctions. Canada also considers the broader political and international contexts when deciding whether sanctions or any other tools in Canada’s foreign policy toolbox may be an appropriate response.</para><para>The Government of Canada will continue to engage on the human rights situation in Eritrea. Promoting and protecting democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is an integral part of Canada’s foreign policy.

Across Gaza, more than 40,000 souls were lost, with approximately 70% being women and children. In the same period, 1,706 Israelis were reported dead. The conflict has not spared the occupied West Bank either, where it claimed the lives of 479 Palestinians, including 116 children, and 9 Israelis.</Para><Para>While these numbers are staggering, rest assured that this is not a number game.

The Government continues to condemn the brutal terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel on October 7, 2023. The Government also recognizes the devastating toll faced by Palestinians as a result of the ensuing conflict. The number of civilians that have been killed is unacceptable. Ongoing restrictions on desperately needed humanitarian aid are intolerable. Canada continues to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and the resumption of UN-led humanitarian aid flows. This war must end now.</para><para>Canada remains committed to advancing progress towards the two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace and security. Co-ordinated international action is needed to preserve the viability of the two-state solution. For these reasons, Canada intends to recognize the State of Palestine at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025. This is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to governance reforms, to holding elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarizing the Palestinian state.</para><para>Canada has one of the strongest export controls systems in the world, and respect for human rights is enshrined in our export controls legislation. This was strengthened by Canada’s accession to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in 2019, implemented by amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA), including to provisions for permit issuance as well as enhancing public reporting requirements. All export permit applications for controlled items are reviewed on a case-by-case basis under Canada’s robust risk assessment framework, including against the ATT criteria which are enshrined in Canada’s EIPA. Canada’s missions abroad are consulted as part of the export permit review process, considering the local and regional situation and associated security risks. Permits to export controlled goods and technology from Canada will not be issued if there is a substantial risk that they could be used to commit or facilitate a violation of International Human Rights or Humanitarian Law.</para><para>The <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/controls-controles/military-goods-2024-marchandises-militaires.aspx?lang=eng"><i>Annual report on Strategic Goods and Technologies Pursuant to Section 27 of the Export and Import Permits Act</i></a> for the year 2024 has been tabled in the Parliament of Canada. The report is tabled annually to promote transparency around Canadian exports of military items and provides information on the export of military goods and technology from Canada in a given calendar year. Global Affairs Canada does not comment on the specifics of transactions due to commercial confidentiality.</para><para>Canada has not approved any new permits for items to Israel that could be used in the current conflict in Gaza since January 8, 2024.  We continue to assess whether other permits are appropriate for potential defensive purposes, including for parts that would go into other items necessary for the Canadian forces. In 2024, Canada also suspended approximately 30 export permits for items destined to Israel that could conceivably have been incorporated into items that could be used in that conflict. All permits suspended in 2024 remain suspended and cannot be used to export to Israel.

Crown corporations are expected to align with the Strategy or adopt an equivalent set of commitments in each significant area of their operations, including the commitment to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 and to be climate-resilient.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39352">Climate change and global warming</Term><Term Id="39188">Financial institutions</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="441-02726" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13556606" Title="451-00057 (Foreign affairs)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="139"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00057</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00057 (Foreign affairs)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Jenny</FirstName><LastName>Kwan</LastName><Constituency>Vancouver East</Constituency><Caucus>NDP</Caucus><ProvinceCode>BC</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 18, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 13, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons in Parliament Assembled to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas:</Para><ul type="disc"><li>Under Common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions, Canada is required to respect international humanitarian law;</li><li>Under Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel as an occupying power must allow and facilitate humanitarian aid by impartial organizations;</li><li>Canada's own international Assistance Accountability Act requires that all Canadian foreign aid uphold human rights and international legal standards; and</li></ul><ul type="disc"><li>Israel's policy and actions violate all of these obligations.</li></ul><Para>Therefore, we, the undersigned, Citizens and Residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>1.

Canada has and will continue to urge Israel to protect civilians, including medical and humanitarian workers, as well as civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, and to ensure the continuity of medical services to the civilian population.</para><para>The government has been vocal on all these messages Here are some recent examples.</para><para>On May 19, 2025, the Prime Minister of Canada, along with the leaders of France and the United Kingdom, issued a public statement calling on the Israeli Government to stop its military operations in Gaza, lift restrictions on humanitarian aid meant to enter Gaza, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a return to the delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles.</para><para>In that statement, the Government of Canada condemned language used by members of the Israeli government threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. The Government of Canada promised concrete actions if Israel did not cease the renewed military offensive, lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid. and cease the expansion of settlements. The Government also stated that permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.</para><para>On June 3, 2025, the Canadian government expressed shock at the deaths of Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza and called for the United Nations -led resumption of aid throughout Gaza. The government also expressed alarm at Israel’s evacuation of Al-Awda Hospital, the last operational medical facility in northern Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza must be able to access life-saving medical aid.</para><para>On June 10, 2025, Canada announced sanctions and other measures targeting Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. These measures were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, and are in response to the recent escalation of violence by Israeli extremist settlers and affiliates against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, contributing to insecurity for both Palestinians and Israelis.  Settlements violate international law and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state and, of a just and lasting peace through a two-state solution.</para><para>On June 16, 2025, as G7 Chair, Canada led on a G7 Leaders’ statement that reiterated the importance of protecting civilians and the de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East. And on June 26, 2025, Canada strongly condemned Israeli fire on Palestinian civilians seeking aid and called on all parties to uphold international humanitarian law and allow United Nations -led humanitarian assistance to reach civilians throughout Gaza.</para><para>Finally, on July 30, 2025, in response to the grave erosion of prospects for a two-state solution, Canada announced its intention to recognize Palestinian statehood. This decision was taken in concert with key allies, recognizing that there was no room for delay in coordinating international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life. This intention is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms, including the commitments by Palestinian Authority President Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.</para><para>Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future.</para><para>Canada’s support for international humanitarian efforts will be facilitated by principled and experienced humanitarian actors to deliver international assistance in Gaza. Examples include the World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation, the Canadian Red Cross, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Canada is a longstanding supporter of the organization, which plays a critical role assisting Palestinians, particularly with their experienced staff working in education and healthcare. Canada has been vocal in support of the Agency, and on October 27, 2024, Canada led a statement with likeminded partner countries opposing Israel’s legislation against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s operations. Since October 7, 2023, Canada has allocated more than $355 million in international assistance to save lives and alleviate suffering for those affected by the conflict. Canada has a robust system in place to ensure that our funds go only to organizations that alleviate suffering by respecting humanitarian principles, upholding human rights and respecting international humanitarian law. The government’s due diligence mechanisms ensure the sound fiscal management of funds.</para><para>Canada strongly supports United States, Egyptian, and Qatari efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal for Gaza. A ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, the resumption of impartial humanitarian aid flows, and good-faith negotiations to secure a permanent end to hostilities are the only way forward.</para><para>A pathway towards a two-state solution is urgently needed.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39265">Foreign policy</Term><Term Id="39613">Humanitarian assistance and workers</Term><Term Id="39730">International conflict and international conflict resolution</Term><Term Id="55374">Israel</Term><Term Id="54310">Palestine</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00047" /><Petition Number="451-00069" /><Petition Number="451-00044" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13562439" Title="451-00056 (Public safety)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="42"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00056</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00056 (Public safety)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Alex</FirstName><LastName>Ruff</LastName><Constituency>Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 18, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 16, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons to the following:</Para><Para>WHEREAS:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>The cell phone number known as "*16" is used to contact the Canadian Coast Guard in the event of water-related emergencies;</li><li>*16 is currently a voluntary offering from telecommunication companies in Canada; and</li><li>*16 is only available in some regions of Canada.</li></ul></Para><Para>THEREFORE, we, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Expand the *16 number by making it accessible Canada-wide by compelling all telecommunications companies recognize *16 to contact the Canadian Coast Guard in the event of water-related emergencies.</li></ul></Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture and Minister responsible for Official Languages</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): The Honourable Steven Guilbeault</signatory><paras><para>The government would like to thank the petitioners for raising this important issue.</para><para>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is an independent quasi-judicial tribunal that regulates the Canadian communications sector in the public interest.

Throughout the year, there are multiple channels through which the government demonstrates this commitment. These include budgets and economic updates (or statements), the estimates documents, which provide detailed projections of planned spending, the Public Accounts of Canada, which include the official annual audited financial statements of the Government of Canada, and the Fiscal Monitor.</para><para>Published by the Department of Finance, the Fiscal Monitor is a monthly report that provides an overview of the federal government’s consolidated financial operations. This allows Canadians to stay informed, with timely updates on revenues, expenses, the budgetary balance, and federal debt, and includes comparisons with the same period in the previous fiscal year.</para><para>The most recent edition of the Fiscal Monitor is available on the Department of Finance Canada’s website and can be accessed here: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/fiscal-monitor/2025/03.html">The Fiscal Monitor - March 2025 - Canada.ca</a>. As detailed therein, the government posted a budgetary deficit of $43.2 billion for the April to March period of the 2024-25 fiscal year, compared to a deficit of $50.9 billion reported for the same period of 2023-24. The budgetary deficit before net actuarial losses was $39.1 billion, compared to a deficit of $43.4 billion in the April to March period of 2023-24. Additionally, compared to 2023-24:</para><ul><li>Revenues were up $50.0 billion, or 11.3 percent, reflecting increases in all categories of revenue.</li><li>Program expenses excluding net actuarial losses were up $39.6 billion, or 9.0 percent, reflecting increases across all major categories of spending, led by direct program expenses.</li><li>Public debt charges increased by $6.2 billion, or 13.0 percent, primarily reflecting higher average effective rates on the outstanding stock of marketable bonds, as well as an increase in the stock of marketable bonds.</li><li>Net actuarial losses decreased by $3.5 billion, or 46.8 percent, reflecting both the amortization of gains arising from actuarial valuations of the government's pension and other employee future benefit plans as of March 31, 2024, and the end of the amortization of certain prior years' net actuarial losses.</li></ul><para>The results reported in the March Fiscal Monitor are not the final results for the fiscal year as a whole. The final results are published in the annual Public Accounts of Canada and incorporate post-March end-of-year adjustments made once further information becomes available, including the accrual of tax revenues reflecting assessments of tax returns and valuation adjustments for assets and liabilities.</para><para>At present, the government is devoting its full attention to responding to fast-changing and unjustified trade actions by the United States, and discussions are ongoing. Although governments often face economic uncertainty, the current situation differs when it comes to the scale, complexity, and immediacy of the risks, and the way they interact. Given the significance of these developments, it would be premature to finalize a multi-year fiscal plan without a clearer view of how Canada’s most important trading relationship will evolve in the near-term. Canadians rightly expect a budget that reflects the full economic and fiscal context and provides a stable, forward-looking economic plan, and the government has committed to tabling a budget this fall.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="246935">Budget 2025</Term><Term Id="38333">Budgetary policy</Term></IndexEntries></Petition><Petition Id="13538913" Title="451-00053 (Taxation)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="49"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00053</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00053 (Taxation)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Arpan</FirstName><LastName>Khanna</LastName><Constituency>Oxford</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 18, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>May 29, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>PETITION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA</Title><Prayer><Para>WHEREAS the NDP-Liberal dominated Finance Committee just recommended that religious organizations such as churches, synagogues, mosques, gurdwaras, and temples be stripped of charitable status.</Para><Para>WHEREAS recommendation 430 of the report endorsed by all parties EXCEPT the Conservatives calls on the government to "Amend the Income Tax Act to provide a definition of a charity which would remove the privileged status of 'advancement of religion' as a charitable purpose."</Para><Para>WHEREAS religious organizations do good work advancing the common good, in Canada and beyond, and rely on charitable status to support their good work through private donations.</Para><Para>WE, THE UNDERSIGNED THE RESIDENTS OF OXFORD, call on the Canadian government to reject the absurd mean-spirited attack on religious organizations recommended by the NDP-Liberal dominated Finance Committee.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Finance and National Revenue</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, P.C., M.P.</signatory><paras><para>The Government of Canada recognizes the vital role that charities, including religious charities, play in delivering essential services to some of the most vulnerable in Canadian society.

In 2022, the Government announced new support through the $250 million Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF) to assist municipalities and Indigenous communities prevent gun and gang violence by tackling root causes. In Spring 2023, the Government announced $390 million over five years to provinces and territories under the Gun and Gang Violence Action Fund to help stop gun crime and gang violence before it starts, bringing our global total to over $640 Million from 2022-2028. The Government is also providing a $54,727,173 allocation to British Columbia to support a variety of initiatives, including for prevention programs and law enforcement. This funding builds on the success of the initial <i>Initiative to Take Action Against Gun and Gang Violence</i>, announced in 2017 through which provinces and territories received $215 million in funding.</para><para>In 2023, the Government introduced Bill C-48, <i>An Act to amend the Criminal Code (bail reform)</i>, which came into force on January 4, 2024. Bill C-48 enacted changes to the <i>Criminal Code</i>’s bail provisions to address repeat, violent offending with weapons and intimate partner violence. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure that Bill C-48 is meeting its objectives, and to identify ways to further strengthen the criminal justice system’s response to repeat and violent offending more broadly.</para><para>Our government agrees that more can be done to address concerns about repeat offending and violent crime. That is why we have committed to pursuing further <i>Criminal Code </i>reform to toughen sentencing laws for repeat offenders and to make bail more onerous to obtain for those charged with violent and organized crime-related auto theft, home invasion, human trafficking and human smuggling.</para><para>All levels of government play an important role in ensuring that our bail functions as intended. Responsibility for Canada’s bail system is shared among federal, provincial and territorial governments and our government is committed to continuing to work collaboratively with our provincial and territorial partners on this issue. At the First Ministers meeting on June 2, 2025, First Ministers emphasized the importance of joint efforts of keeping communities safe across Canada and directed federal-provincial-territorial Attorneys General and Ministers of Justice and Public Safety to bring forward an action plan. This work is currently underway through ongoing intergovernmental collaboration.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="55298">Bail</Term><Term Id="40751">Safety</Term></IndexEntries></Petition><Petition Id="13551366" Title="451-00048 (Taxation)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="30"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00048</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00048 (Taxation)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Brad</FirstName><LastName>Redekopp</LastName><Constituency>Saskatoon West</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>SK</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 18, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 11, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>PETITION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw attention of the Government of Canada to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Recommendation 430 of the House of Commons Finance Committee's pre-budget report proposes removing the "advancement of religion" as a recognized charitable purpose under the Income Tax Act;</li><li>Recommendation 429 proposes revoking charitable status from anti-abortion organizations;</li><li>Religious charities in Canada provide vital services to society, including food banks, care for seniors, newcomer support, youth programs, and mental health outreach - all rooted in their faith traditions;</li><li>These communities promote hope, belonging, social cohesion, and compassion, benefiting both their members and the broader public;</li><li>Freedom of religion and belief are fundamental rights in Canada, protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and</li><li>Singling out or excluding faith-based charities from the charitable sector based on religious belief undermines the diversity and pluralism foundational to Canadian society.</li></ul></Para><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>1.

Canada has and will continue to urge Israel to protect civilians, including medical and humanitarian workers, as well as civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, and to ensure the continuity of medical services to the civilian population.</para><para>The government has been vocal on all these messages Here are some recent examples.</para><para>On May 19, 2025, the Prime Minister of Canada, along with the leaders of France and the United Kingdom, issued a public statement calling on the Israeli Government to stop its military operations in Gaza, lift restrictions on humanitarian aid meant to enter Gaza, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a return to the delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles.</para><para>In that statement, the Government of Canada condemned language used by members of the Israeli government threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. The Government of Canada promised concrete actions if Israel did not cease the renewed military offensive, lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid. and cease the expansion of settlements. The Government also stated that permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.</para><para>On June 3, 2025, the Canadian government expressed shock at the deaths of Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza and called for the United Nations -led resumption of aid throughout Gaza. The government also expressed alarm at Israel’s evacuation of Al-Awda Hospital, the last operational medical facility in northern Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza must be able to access life-saving medical aid.</para><para>On June 10, 2025, Canada announced sanctions and other measures targeting Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. These measures were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, and are in response to the recent escalation of violence by Israeli extremist settlers and affiliates against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, contributing to insecurity for both Palestinians and Israelis.  Settlements violate international law and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state and, of a just and lasting peace through a two-state solution.</para><para>On June 16, 2025, as G7 Chair, Canada led on a G7 Leaders’ statement that reiterated the importance of protecting civilians and the de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East. And on June 26, 2025, Canada strongly condemned Israeli fire on Palestinian civilians seeking aid and called on all parties to uphold international humanitarian law and allow United Nations -led humanitarian assistance to reach civilians throughout Gaza.</para><para>Finally, on July 30, 2025, in response to the grave erosion of prospects for a two-state solution, Canada announced its intention to recognize Palestinian statehood. This decision was taken in concert with key allies, recognizing that there was no room for delay in coordinating international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life. This intention is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms, including the commitments by Palestinian Authority President Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.</para><para>Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future.</para><para>Canada’s support for international humanitarian efforts will be facilitated by principled and experienced humanitarian actors to deliver international assistance in Gaza. Examples include the World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation, the Canadian Red Cross, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Canada is a longstanding supporter of the organization, which plays a critical role assisting Palestinians, particularly with their experienced staff working in education and healthcare. Canada has been vocal in support of the Agency, and on October 27, 2024, Canada led a statement with likeminded partner countries opposing Israel’s legislation against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s operations. Since October 7, 2023, Canada has allocated more than $355 million in international assistance to save lives and alleviate suffering for those affected by the conflict. Canada has a robust system in place to ensure that our funds go only to organizations that alleviate suffering by respecting humanitarian principles, upholding human rights and respecting international humanitarian law. The government’s due diligence mechanisms ensure the sound fiscal management of funds.</para><para>Canada strongly supports United States, Egyptian, and Qatari efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal for Gaza. A ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, the resumption of impartial humanitarian aid flows, and good-faith negotiations to secure a permanent end to hostilities are the only way forward.</para><para>A pathway towards a two-state solution is urgently needed.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39265">Foreign policy</Term><Term Id="39613">Humanitarian assistance and workers</Term><Term Id="39730">International conflict and international conflict resolution</Term><Term Id="55374">Israel</Term><Term Id="54310">Palestine</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00069" /><Petition Number="451-00057" /><Petition Number="451-00044" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13544702" Title="451-00046 (Health)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="52"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00046</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00046 (Health)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Cheryl</FirstName><LastName>Gallant</LastName><Constituency>Algonquin—Renfrew—Pembroke</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 17, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 6, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>PETITION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA </Title><Prayer><Para>Whereas:<ul type="disc"><li>Parliament has neither discussed nor debated Canada's participation in a proposed World Health Organization (WHO) International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) that is currently being negotiated and due to be signed by May 2024;</li><li>In parallel to the Pandemic Treaty drafting process, hundreds of amendments have been proposed by 16 member states to the International Health Regulations (IHRs), which govern the conduct of countries and provide the legal framework for the WHO to exercise its powers;</li><li>Parliament has neither discussed nor debated the amendments to 5 Articles of the IHR that were adopted by the 75th World Health Assembly on May 27, 2022 and states have 18 months to opt out of these amendments;</li><li>The outcomes of these efforts will give legally binding, "emergency" powers to the WHO, with potential far- reaching impacts on the lives, health and human rights of Canadians; and</li><li>Canada must be careful not to agree to anything that could give away our sovereignty on health care, even if there is tremendous international pressure to do so for the sake of pandemic preparedness.</li></ul></Para><Para>We, the undersigned, citizens of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to urgently allow Parliament the opportunity to debate and vote on the amendments to the IHRs that have already been adopted by the 75th World Health Assembly and to allow opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of the proposed amendments currently being negotiated by WHO delegates.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Health</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): Maggie Chi</signatory><paras><para>Canada’s sovereignty over its health care will always be maintained.

Canada has and will continue to urge Israel to protect civilians, including medical and humanitarian workers, as well as civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, and to ensure the continuity of medical services to the civilian population.</para><para>The government has been vocal on all these messages Here are some recent examples.</para><para>On May 19, 2025, the Prime Minister of Canada, along with the leaders of France and the United Kingdom, issued a public statement calling on the Israeli Government to stop its military operations in Gaza, lift restrictions on humanitarian aid meant to enter Gaza, and engage with the United Nations to ensure a return to the delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles.</para><para>In that statement, the Government of Canada condemned language used by members of the Israeli government threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. The Government of Canada promised concrete actions if Israel did not cease the renewed military offensive, lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid. and cease the expansion of settlements. The Government also stated that permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.</para><para>On June 3, 2025, the Canadian government expressed shock at the deaths of Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza and called for the United Nations -led resumption of aid throughout Gaza. The government also expressed alarm at Israel’s evacuation of Al-Awda Hospital, the last operational medical facility in northern Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza must be able to access life-saving medical aid.</para><para>On June 10, 2025, Canada announced sanctions and other measures targeting Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. These measures were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, and are in response to the recent escalation of violence by Israeli extremist settlers and affiliates against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, contributing to insecurity for both Palestinians and Israelis.  Settlements violate international law and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state and, of a just and lasting peace through a two-state solution.</para><para>On June 16, 2025, as G7 Chair, Canada led on a G7 Leaders’ statement that reiterated the importance of protecting civilians and the de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East. And on June 26, 2025, Canada strongly condemned Israeli fire on Palestinian civilians seeking aid and called on all parties to uphold international humanitarian law and allow United Nations -led humanitarian assistance to reach civilians throughout Gaza.</para><para>Finally, on July 30, 2025, in response to the grave erosion of prospects for a two-state solution, Canada announced its intention to recognize Palestinian statehood. This decision was taken in concert with key allies, recognizing that there was no room for delay in coordinating international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life. This intention is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms, including the commitments by Palestinian Authority President Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.</para><para>Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future.</para><para>Canada’s support for international humanitarian efforts will be facilitated by principled and experienced humanitarian actors to deliver international assistance in Gaza. Examples include the World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation, the Canadian Red Cross, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Canada is a longstanding supporter of the organization, which plays a critical role assisting Palestinians, particularly with their experienced staff working in education and healthcare. Canada has been vocal in support of the Agency, and on October 27, 2024, Canada led a statement with likeminded partner countries opposing Israel’s legislation against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East’s operations. Since October 7, 2023, Canada has allocated more than $355 million in international assistance to save lives and alleviate suffering for those affected by the conflict. Canada has a robust system in place to ensure that our funds go only to organizations that alleviate suffering by respecting humanitarian principles, upholding human rights and respecting international humanitarian law. The government’s due diligence mechanisms ensure the sound fiscal management of funds.</para><para>Canada strongly supports United States, Egyptian, and Qatari efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal for Gaza. A ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, the resumption of impartial humanitarian aid flows, and good-faith negotiations to secure a permanent end to hostilities are the only way forward.</para><para>A pathway towards a two-state solution is urgently needed.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39265">Foreign policy</Term><Term Id="39613">Humanitarian assistance and workers</Term><Term Id="39730">International conflict and international conflict resolution</Term><Term Id="55374">Israel</Term><Term Id="54310">Palestine</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00047" /><Petition Number="451-00069" /><Petition Number="451-00057" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="12348408" Title="451-00043 (Justice)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="25"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00043</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00043 (Justice)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Brad</FirstName><LastName>Vis</LastName><Constituency>Mission—Matsqui—Abbotsford</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>BC</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 16, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>April 24, 2023</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada</Title><Prayer><Para>WHEREAS:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Amendments were made to the Criminal Code on June 23, 2022, allowing for extreme intoxication to act as a defense for violent crimes like assault and sexual assault where a "reasonable person would not have foreseen the risk of a violent loss of control";</li><li>The National Enquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found that rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls to be alarmingly higher than any other demographic in Canada;</li><li>First Nation communities are often in rural areas under-served by law enforcement creating longer response times and greater potential for violent acts of crime; and</li><li>Alcoholism and substance abuse is a rapidly growing issue leaving First Nations more vulnerable to acts of violence.

The SCC held that section 33.1 violated sections 7 (the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person except in accordance with a principle of fundamental justice) and 11(d) (the presumption of innocence) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> and declared it to be unconstitutional because individuals could be convicted of a crime of violence in circumstances where they did not meet the minimum requirements for criminal liability.</para><para>The <i>Brown</i> decision created a gap in the law that would have allowed accused persons charged with violent crimes, such as assault or sexual assault, to escape liability in cases where they negligently became extremely intoxicated, lost control and harmed another person.</para><para>Parliament re-enacted a new section 33.1 in 2022 in response to the <i>Brown </i>decision.

The situation that Afghans are facing – particularly women and girls – is unacceptable. With every edict, the Taliban restrict even further women’s and girls’ access to fundamental aspects of public life, such as education, healthcare, employment, and participation in society. The exclusion of women and girls from public life is a collective blow to Afghanistan’s long-term development, economic growth and prosperity, and general stability. In light of this, Canada remains committed to maintaining a principled and coordinated approach that centers human rights, especially women’s and girls’ rights, in its engagement on Afghanistan.</para><para>Canada remains actively engaged with partners, including civil society organizations and stakeholders to denounce the Taliban’s horrific and continuous violations of Afghan women’s and girls’ human rights, preserve and advance their rights, and call for a strong international response to these violations. Canada uses every opportunity to call on the Taliban to reverse all restrictions imposed on women and girls, condemning reported human rights violations in Afghanistan at the United Nations and other multilateral forums, both in its national capacity and jointly with its international partners. Canada also stands firmly behind the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, whose role Canada helped establish and strengthen.</para><para>Canada actively participated in the recent discussions related to the <i>Draft Articles on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Humanity</i> which took place in the context of the Legal Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. In this context and elsewhere, including the work of the <i>United Nations</i><i /><i>Working Group on Discrimination Against Women and Girls</i>, Canada continues to closely follow the ongoing discussions surrounding the concept of “gender apartheid,” which is not currently defined under international law, and welcomes hearing different perspectives on this matter.</para><para>Canada strongly supports and prioritizes accountability efforts for human rights violations and atrocity crimes under the existing international legal framework. This includes the current investigation into the situation in Afghanistan by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Canada respects the independence of the Office of the Prosecutor in the conduct of the investigation and notes that the Court issued arrest warrants against two Taliban leaders for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds. Canada is also contributing $2 million to assist the Office of the Prosecutor’s Trust Fund for the enhancement of dedicated and specialised capacity with respect to investigations into crimes of sexual and gender-based violence and crimes against and affecting children.</para><para>In addition, Canada, along with Australia, Germany and the Netherlands, formally took steps in September 2024 to hold Afghanistan accountable under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

As such, the federal Government recognizes the importance of working with provinces and territories to find solutions to common challenges.  </para><para>This petition calls for the implementation of a Guaranteed Livable Income, which can be viewed as equivalent to a basic income. The Government of Canada already has ongoing programs with features of a partial basic income, such as the Canada Child Benefit for families with children as well as the Old Age Security (OAS) pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors. In addition, existing programs such as the Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) and Employment Insurance (EI) help low-income individuals that have labour market attachment or those with insurable employment. These and other initiatives have contributed to progress on lifting Canadians out of poverty. These programs exist alongside provincial and territorial programs, including those that deliver social assistance.  </para><para>In addition, the Government is continuing to focus on measures that will help to alleviate poverty and inequality. For example, the Government has recently expanded the Canadian Dental Care Plan to cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year. Furthermore, the first payments of the new Canada Disability Benefit will begin in July 2025, and are estimated to increase the financial well-being of over 600,000 low-income persons with disabilities.  </para><para>The Government is also working with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners to build a Canada-wide, community-based early learning child care system. The federal government is providing provinces and territories with significant funding to support substantial reductions to families for the cost of regulated child care spaces.  </para><para>The Government of Canada also undertakes research and analysis on potential basic income programs and other approaches that could positively impact Canada’s economy and society, as part of its efforts to tackle poverty and to ensure that all Canadians have a real and fair opportunity to succeed. </para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39456">Guaranteed annual income</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00162" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="11720848" Title="451-00031 (Civil and human rights)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="41"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00031</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00031 (Civil and human rights)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Tamara</FirstName><LastName>Kronis</LastName><Constituency>Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>BC</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 9, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>May 2, 2022</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons </Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas: </Para><Para>Canadians have the right to be protected against discrimination;</Para><Para> Canadians can and do face political discrimination;</Para><Para>It is a fundamental Canadian right to be politically active and vocal;</Para><Para>It is in the best interest of Canadian democracy to protect public debate and the exchange of differing ideas; and</Para><Para> Bill C-257 seeks to add protection against political discrimination to the Canadian Human Rights Act.</Para><Para>Therefore we, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the House of Commons to:</Para><Para>1.

Wherever possible, Canada coordinates closely with likeminded allies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, to maximize the effectiveness of sanctions.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="70601">Bahrain</Term><Term Id="55663">Civil and human rights</Term><Term Id="39265">Foreign policy</Term><Term Id="55043">Pakistan</Term><Term Id="66573">Turkey</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="441-01893" /><Petition Number="441-01514" /><Petition Number="441-01510" /><Petition Number="441-01557" /><Petition Number="441-01731" /><Petition Number="441-01841" /><Petition Number="441-01949" /><Petition Number="441-02169" /><Petition Number="441-02917" /><Petition Number="441-02957" /><Petition Number="441-01832" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="12165965" Title="451-00023 (Justice)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="25"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00023</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00023 (Justice)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 5, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>December 20, 2022</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada</Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons to the following:</Para><Para>Whereas:<ul type="disc"><li>Louis Roy of the Quebec College of Physicians recommended expanding euthanasia to "babies from birth to one year of age who come into the world with severe deformities and very serious syndromes";</li><li>This proposal for the legalized killing of infants is deeply disturbing to many Canadians; and</li><li>Infanticide is always wrong.</li></ul></Para><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call on the Government of Canada to block any attempt to allow the killing of children.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY PATRICIA LATTANZIO</signatory><paras><para>Canada’s medical assistance in dying (MAID) regime permits persons who meet all the eligibility criteria in section 241.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to receive MAID.

The legal framework for MAID balances different interests and societal values.</para><para>Provinces and territories manage the delivery of health services, including MAID as part of end-of-life or complex care. The federal government, however, is responsible for the federal legal framework for MAID in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, setting minimum requirements for the lawful provision of MAID in Canada. These requirements include eligibility criteria to determine who can obtain MAID and procedural safeguards to ensure its safe provision. MAID has been the subject of many judicial challenges which shaped the legal framework.</para><para>As there are additional challenges that arise in the context of MAID for persons whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, the federal legal framework sets out safeguards that must be satisfied in those instances. These safeguards aim to address the risks associated with diverse sources of suffering and vulnerability, that could lead someone not close to death to seek MAID. The safeguards examine whether their suffering results from factors other than the medical condition and whether there are ways of addressing their suffering other than through MAID. For example, a minimum 90-day assessment period seeks to ensure enough time to explore all relevant aspects of the person’s situation, including the availability of treatments or services that could help reduce their suffering like counselling services, mental health and disability support services, community services and palliative care. Additionally, at least one of the two mandatory eligibility assessments must be done by a practitioner with expertise in the condition causing the person’s suffering or in consultation with another practitioner with such expertise, ensuring all treatment options are identified and explored. The patient and practitioners must also agree that the person has seriously considered alternatives to alleviate their suffering.</para><para>Our government understands that the disability community continues to be concerned about MAID and we are committed to continue working to ensure the disability community’s needs and voices are incorporated into these complex issues.

This is an important issue. The Government previously tabled online harms legislation, which recognized the need to better protect children online. Although the proposed legislation died on the Order Paper in January 2025, the government’s commitments to protect children and address online harms remain.</para><para>Government legislation proposed to create the <i>Online Harms Act</i>, which aimed to promote online safety by reducing exposure to harmful content on social media services, with a special emphasis on protecting children. The <i>Online Harms Act</i> would have imposed three statutory duties that establish minimum standards that services must meet to ensure the safety of Canadians online:</para><ol><li>Duty to Act Responsibly</li><li>Duty to Protect Children</li><li>Duty to Make Certain Content Inaccessible</li></ol><para>The Duty to Act Responsibly would have established a standard of conduct that social media services must follow to ensure the safety of users on their platforms and to create more transparency and accountability about how they deal with harmful content.</para><para>The Duty to Protect Children would have required social media services to provide protections for children online including the integration of age-appropriate design features on their platforms and to be more transparent by reporting on the specific measures that they are taking to protect children. Design features could have included things like defaults for parental controls, default settings related to warning labels for children, or safe search settings for a service’s internal search function. They could also have included design features to limit children’s exposure to harmful content, including explicit adult content, cyberbullying content, and content that incites self-harm.</para><para>The Duty to Make Certain Content Inaccessible would have required social media services to expeditiously remove two categories of content from their services:</para><ol><li>Content that sexually victimizes a child or revictimizes a survivor, and</li><li>Intimate content communicated without consent.</li></ol><para>The Act also would have created a new Digital Safety Commission of Canada to oversee and enforce the Act; a Digital Safety Ombudsperson of Canada to advocate for and support victims and a Digital Safety Office of Canada to support both administratively. Part of the Digital Safety Commission’s mandate would have been to enforce the removal of content that sexually victimizes a child or revictimizes a survivor and intimate content communicated without consent; and to promote societal resilience to harms online and set new standards for online safety by providing guidance to services on how to mitigate risk, perform research, work with stakeholders, and develop educational resources for the public, including children and parents. Overall, the Digital Safety Commission would have been able to enact guidelines and regulations under the three duties, which would allow the legislation to be adaptable and to grow over time as the landscape of harmful content affecting children changes.</para><para>The government remains committed to protecting children in future digital policy endeavors and intends to reintroduce legislation to that effect in the 45<sup>th</sup> legislature.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="61988">Internet</Term><Term Id="39845">Legal age</Term><Term Id="40435">Pornography</Term><Term Id="41420">Young people</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="441-00868" /><Petition Number="441-00729" /><Petition Number="441-00857" /><Petition Number="441-01759" /><Petition Number="441-01814" /><Petition Number="441-02192" /><Petition Number="441-02193" /><Petition Number="441-02205" /><Petition Number="441-02285" /><Petition Number="441-02284" /><Petition Number="441-02283" /><Petition Number="441-02447" /><Petition Number="441-02065" /><Petition Number="441-02016" /><Petition Number="441-02181" /><Petition Number="441-02161" /><Petition Number="441-02112" /><Petition Number="441-02616" /><Petition Number="441-02623" /><Petition Number="441-02659" /><Petition Number="441-02460" /><Petition Number="441-02599" /><Petition Number="441-02921" /><Petition Number="451-00076" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13521177" Title="451-00018 (Parliament and politics)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="29"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00018</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00018 (Parliament and politics)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Garnett</FirstName><LastName>Genuis</LastName><Constituency>Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>AB</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 5, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>December 17, 2024</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons </Title><Prayer><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, draw the attention of the House of Commons to the following: </Para><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Canada made us all a promise, that promise was that anyone from anywhere could do anything;</li><li>Now, after nine years of this Prime Minister, the promise of Canada has been broken. He has broken a lot of promises. He promised to balance the budget, to reduce taxes on the middle class, and to build more affordable housing, but all those promises were broken;</li><li>So many hardworking young Canadians who are 35 living in their parent's basements. This never happened before this Prime Minister came along with his policies that doubled housing costs. Every month, 2,000 people line up at food banks. There are 1,800 homeless encampments across Ontario. This has never been seen before. This is the type of thing we see in third world countries. People are dying in these encampments. Gun violence is up 120% since this Prime Minister went after hunters while letting criminals and gun smugglers go free;</li><li>It is time to axe the tax to make work pay off again, so that servers, truck drivers and plumbers who work more earn more and bring home powerful paycheques. For that to happen, though, people need a roof over their heads. Currently, Canada has fewer homes per capita than any other G7 country. There is too much red tape. We must incentivize municipalities to speed up building permits, cut building taxes and free up land for building, while axing the tax that stands in the way of construction, so that young people still have a chance of getting a home. We must cap population growth so that the housing stock grows faster than the population; and</li><li>We must fix the budget with a law that requires the government to find one dollar of savings for every new dollar of spending. This is how parents, seniors and small businesses balance their budgets, and they expect us to adopt the same common-sense approach. We must cut the use of consultants. We must cut bureaucracy, waste and big handouts to multinational corporations that are offshoring our money. We must cut all that to bring the money home so we can lower deficits, inflation and interest rates and fund our social services. We must stop the crime not by banning hunting rifles but by being tough on criminals and strengthening the border. By doing this, Canada can bring home a country where hard work earns a more powerful paycheque that buys affordable food, gas and homes in safe communities, where anyone from anywhere can do anything through hard work. That is the promise of Canada, and that is what we must bring home.</li></ul></Para><Para>Therefore we, the undersigned citizens and residents, call on the Government of Canada to:</Para><Para>Axe the tax. Build Homes. Fix the Budget. Stop the Crime. Call an immediate carbon tax election so that Canadians can judge the government for its many failures and replace the government with a new common sense conservative government that will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.</Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Finance and National Revenue</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, P.C., M.P.</signatory><paras><para>The Government of Canada ceased the application of the federal fuel charge, effective April 1, 2025, and removed requirements for provinces and territories to have a consumer-facing carbon price as of that date. On June 5, 2025, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-4, the <i>Making Life More Affordable for Canadians Act</i>, which, among other things, removes the carbon pricing for consumers by repealing Part 1 of the <i>Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act</i> and the <i>Fuel Charge Regulations</i>.</para><para>These actions refocus federal carbon pollution pricing standards on ensuring carbon pricing systems are in place across Canada on a broad range of greenhouse gas emissions from industry. A price on pollution for large emitters will continue to be a pillar of Canada’s plan to build a strong economy and greener future. It is a system that is fair and effective. Industrial carbon pricing is one of the most important greenhouse gas emission reduction policies in the government’s comprehensive Emissions Reduction Plan to bend the curve and meet Canada’s 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Carbon pricing systems for industry are also designed to keep costs low to protect against competitiveness risks.</para><para>The government intends to engage with provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, and stakeholders on changes to the minimum national stringency standards for carbon pollution pricing, known as the federal ‘benchmark’ criteria.</para><para>The Government of Canada is also taking action to make life more affordable for Canadians. For example, to lower the upfront cost of buying a new home for young Canadians and spur the construction of new homes across the country, as part of Bill C-4, the <i>Making Life More Affordable for Canadians Act</i>, the government is introducing the First-Time Home Buyers’ GST Rebate. This new rebate would eliminate the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for first-time home buyers on new homes up to $1 million and reduce the GST for first-time home buyers on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million—saving first-time home buyers up to $50,000 on a new home. This measure is expected to deliver $3.9 billion in tax savings to Canadians over five years, starting in 2025-26.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="38333">Budgetary policy</Term><Term Id="38425">Carbon tax</Term><Term Id="38741">Crime prevention</Term><Term Id="39593">Housing</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00078" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13544134" Title="451-00017 (Justice)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="44"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00017</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00017 (Justice)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Marilyn</FirstName><LastName>Gladu</LastName><Constituency>Sarnia—Lambton—Bkejwanong</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 5, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>June 4, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the House of Commons</Title><Prayer><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>Choosing medical assistance in dying (MAID) due to lack of available services or treatments is not a real choice;</li><li>Allowing medical assistance in dying for those with disabilities or chronic illness who are not dying devalues their lives, tacitly endorsing the notion that life with disability is optional, and by extension, dispensable;</li><li>Offering medical assistance in dying as a "solution" for disability or chronic illness reduces incentives to improve treatment and care for people with these conditions;</li><li>Canadians do not want an ableist healthcare system where the lives of those with disabilities are seen as not worth living;</li><li>Many disability advocates in Canada have expressed opposition to allowing MAID for people with disabilities.</li></ul></Para><Para>Therefore we, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to:<ul type="disc"><li>Protect all Canadians whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable by prohibiting medical assistance in dying for those whose prognosis for natural death is more than six months.</li></ul></Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY PATRICIA LATTANZIO</signatory><paras><para>Medical assistance in dying (MAID) is a complex and deeply personal matter and there are diverging views across the country.

The legal framework for MAID balances different interests and societal values.</para><para>Provinces and territories manage the delivery of health services, including MAID as part of end-of-life or complex care. The federal government, however, is responsible for the federal legal framework for MAID in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, setting minimum requirements for the lawful provision of MAID in Canada. These requirements include eligibility criteria to determine who can obtain MAID and procedural safeguards to ensure its safe provision. MAID has been the subject of many judicial challenges which shaped the legal framework.</para><para>As there are additional challenges that arise in the context of MAID for persons whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, the federal legal framework sets out safeguards that must be satisfied in those instances. These safeguards aim to address the risks associated with diverse sources of suffering and vulnerability, that could lead someone not close to death to seek MAID. The safeguards examine whether their suffering results from factors other than the medical condition and whether there are ways of addressing their suffering other than through MAID. For example, a minimum 90-day assessment period seeks to ensure enough time to explore all relevant aspects of the person’s situation, including the availability of treatments or services that could help reduce their suffering like counselling services, mental health and disability support services, community services and palliative care. Additionally, at least one of the two mandatory eligibility assessments must be done by a practitioner with expertise in the condition causing the person’s suffering or in consultation with another practitioner with such expertise, ensuring all treatment options are identified and explored. The patient and practitioners must also agree that the person has seriously considered alternatives to alleviate their suffering.</para><para>Our government understands that the disability community continues to be concerned about MAID and we are committed to continue working to ensure the disability community’s needs and voices are incorporated into these complex issues.

Many of the Cohen recommendations are broad reaching, and consequently, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), in collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and the Province of British Columbia (B.C.), has taken action to address all 75 recommendations and continues its work across several key areas, such as salmon stock assessment, health status assessment, habitat protection and restoration, salmon aquaculture, and fisheries management. Commitment to ongoing action is reflected in the <i>Wild Salmon Policy 2018-2022 Implementation Plan </i>(<a href="https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/ip-pmo/index-eng.html">Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan</a>)<i>. </i>A five-year report of the <i>Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan</i> was published on September 21, 2023 (<a href="https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/annual-annuel/5-year-annee-eng.html">Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan: 5 year review</a>), which outlines specific activities and approaches led by DFO towards restoring and maintaining healthy and diverse Pacific salmon populations and their habitats.</para><para>The Cohen Response Status Update Report, published in October 2018 (<a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/cohen/report-rapport-2018-eng.htm">Cohen Response Status Update – October 2018</a>) and its corresponding Annex (<a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/cohen/annex-annexe-2018-eng.htm">Annex to the Cohen Response 2018 Status Update: recommendation response detail</a>) provide more details on DFO’s actions to date in response to the Cohen Commission recommendations and the <i>Wild Salmon Policy 2018-2022 Implementation Plan </i>(<a href="https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/ip-pmo/index-eng.html">Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan</a>).</para><para>Additionally, the <i>2020 to 2021 Annual Report</i> of the <i>Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan </i>(<a href="https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/salmon-saumon/wsp-pss/annual-annuel/2020-2021-eng.html">Wild Salmon Policy 2018 to 2022 Implementation Plan: Annual Report 2020 to 2021</a>) published on February 4, 2022, highlights the progress made in implementing the <i>Wild Salmon Policy 2018-2022 Implementation Plan</i>.</para><para>Furthermore, the Government of Canada recognizes that a bold and targeted response with concrete actions to address the historic declines facing Pacific salmon is required. In response, the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) establishes a comprehensive and transformative approach to support Pacific salmon rebuilding. Working collaboratively with Indigenous groups, partners and stakeholders across B.C. and the Yukon, the main goal of this initiative is to conserve and restore wild Pacific salmon stocks and their ecosystems for all that depend on them. The PSSI’s four pillars to achieve this goal are: conservation and stewardship; salmon enhancement; harvest transformation; and integration and collaboration.</para><para>DFO has addressed the Cohen Commission’s Recommendation 3: “The Government of Canada should remove from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ mandate the promotion of salmon farming as an industry and farmed salmon as a product” as per the ‘Annex to the Cohen Response 2018 Status Update: recommendation response detail’ (<a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/cohen/annex-annexe-2018-eng.htm">Annex to the Cohen Response 2018 Status Update: recommendation response detail</a>).</para><para>The petition highlights Cohen Commission’s Recommendation 15: “The Department of Fisheries and Oceans should explicitly consider proximity to migrating Fraser River Sockeye when siting salmon farms” and Recommendation 17: “The Department of Fisheries and Oceans should apply revised siting criteria to all licensed salmon farm sites. Farms that no longer comply with siting criteria should be promptly removed or relocated to sites that comply with current siting criteria.” It is also important to note Recommendation 19 in consideration of responses to Recommendations 15 and 17: “ On September 30, 2020, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans should prohibit net-pen salmon farming in the Discovery Islands (fish health sub-zone 3-2) unless he or she is satisfied that such farms pose at most a minimal risk of serious harm to the health of migrating Fraser River Sockeye salmon. The Minister’s decision should summarize the information relied on and include detailed reasons. The decision should be published on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ website.”</para><para>In response to Recommendation 19, the Department looked at the overall risk to Fraser River Sockeye Salmon from pathogens that can be found at Atlantic salmon farms, which was important in assessing whether current siting criteria are sufficient in the protection of wild salmon stocks, including migrating Fraser River Sockeye. The Department completed risk assessments on nine known pathogens, assessing the risk of these pathogens coming from aquaculture operations in the Discovery Islands area to Fraser River Sockeye. It was concluded that each pathogen posed no more than a minimal risk to Fraser River Sockeye Salmon abundance and diversity under the current fish health management practices (<a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/cohen/recherche-aquaculture-research-eng.html">Aquaculture research related to Cohen Commission recommendation 19</a>). DFO continues to update its understanding of pathogens and pests and adapt its management in response.</para><para>Siting of aquaculture operations is a shared and harmonized process in B.C., requiring a provincial crown tenure, a federal navigable waters permit, and a federal aquaculture licence. Aquaculture applications are submitted through a single portal, where the Government of B.C. considers siting through the lens of granting leases for provincial crown lands, Transport Canada considers siting related to safe navigation, and DFO considers siting relating to potential impacts to fish and fish habitat, potential impacts to existing fisheries, and fish health and wild-farmed salmon interactions, which includes consideration of the proximity to wild salmon migration routes.</para><para>Siting guidelines inform a proponent and the public on how a new or amendment application will be assessed. Licence conditions for aquaculture set out the specific operational and reporting requirements to which licence holders must adhere in order to operate legally and be in compliance with the <i>Fisheries Act</i> and associated regulations. They also contain provisions to ensure that aquaculture sites are operated in an environmentally sustainable manner that minimizes the risk to wild fish stocks and the marine resource.</para><para>In fall 2020, the Department consulted with First Nations in the Discovery Islands to hear their views and concerns with respect to the aquaculture sites in the area. These perspectives informed the former Minister’s decision in December 2020 to phase out Atlantic salmon aquaculture in the area by June 2022. While the Federal Court ultimately struck down that decision, the former Minister decided in June 2022 not to reissue Atlantic salmon aquaculture licences in the Discovery Islands, and to consult with First Nations and industry on the future of licensing in the area. In February 2023, following six months of consultations, the former Minister decided not to reissue licences in the Discovery Islands. Industry and some of the First Nations in the area filed a judicial review in Federal Court in March 2023 which is still a matter before the courts.</para><para>On June 19, 2024, the Government of Canada released a Policy Statement on the future of open net-pen salmon farming in B.C., and its approach was confirmed on September 20, 2024.</para><para>In relation to the Cohen Commission’s Recommendation 54: “The Department of Fisheries and Oceans should encourage the Province of B.C.: to require users of pesticides in forestry and agriculture to record, and report annually to the province, the areas where pesticides were applied and the amounts used to develop and maintain a pesticide-use database (that includes information on location, volume / concentration, and timing of use) and make that information publicly available”, B.C. has a system in place to monitor, report, and disseminate information on pesticide use across sectors (aquaculture, agriculture, forestry). The province requires users to report pesticide use, and has the ability to provide information on total use. Standards of use are consistent with Health Canada requirements.. Under the authority of the <i>Aquaculture Activities Regulations</i>, DFO collects and publishes information regarding the deposit of deleterious substances, including both drugs and pesticides. Prior to any deposit of registered pesticides, including hydrogen peroxide, the owner/operator must notify DFO at least 72 hours in advance.</para><para>Both ECCC and DFO have taken action in response the Cohen Commission’s Recommendation 74: “To improve future sustainability of the Fraser River Sockeye, the Government of Canada should champion, within Canada and internationally, reasonable steps to address the causes of warming waters and climate change.” DFO works to address climate change impacts in aquatic ecosystems as a part of an ECCC-led, whole-of-government effort. Through this work, the department conducts vulnerability assessments on Pacific species, including salmon, to warming waters and continues to monitor trends in sea surface temperature, oxygen levels, and ocean acidification in freshwater and marine areas. These monitoring data are important to understanding the causes of change and are used by DFO in studies to quantify the rate of change in freshwaters and marine waters inhabited by Pacific salmon.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="97972">Cohen Commission</Term><Term Id="39227">Fisheries policy</Term><Term Id="41612">Fisheries stocks</Term><Term Id="39282">Fraser River</Term><Term Id="40271">Pacific fisheries</Term><Term Id="40919">Sockeye salmon</Term></IndexEntries><IdenticalPetitions><Petition Number="451-00082" /></IdenticalPetitions></Petition><Petition Id="13538618" Title="451-00014 (Health)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="25"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00014</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00014 (Health)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Elizabeth</FirstName><LastName>May</LastName><Constituency>Saanich—Gulf Islands</Constituency><Caucus>Green Party</Caucus><ProvinceCode>BC</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>June 3, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>May 21, 2025</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED</Title><Prayer><Para>Whereas: <ul type="disc"><li>Statistics Canada cites that approximately 4.8 million Canadians do not have a regular doctor;</li><li>Despite the number of physicians in Canada growing, the number of Canadians without a regular doctor remains stable;</li><li>92 per cent of physicians work in urban centres, while just 8 per cent work in rural areas; and, </li><li>In Victoria and Sidney, B.C., average wait time for a walk-in clinic are 92 and 180 minutes respectively,</li></ul></Para><Para>We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Canada call upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to:<ul type="disc"><li>Work with all the provinces and territories in Canada to come to a holistic and fair solution to Canada's family doctor shortage</li></ul></Para></Prayer></Petition></Prayer><Response><document schema-code="government-response-for-petition-v1"><content language="en"><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Health</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): Maggie Chi</signatory><paras><para>Primary care is the backbone of high-performing health care, serving as Canadians’ first point of contact with the system and playing a critical role in the delivery of health services.

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) is the lead department in establishing approach distances to marine mammals through the <i>Marine Mammal Regulations</i>, such as the200- meter approach distance for killer whales in Pacific waters. The Government has proposed to amend the approach distance to 1,000 metres for Southern Resident killer whales through amendments to these regulations. The process for amending the <i>Marine Mammal Regulations</i> is ongoing and is detailed in the <a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/publications/mammals-mammiferes/regulations-amendments-modifications-reglement/index-eng.html">What We Heard report</a> that was published in 2025.

One such measure further prohibits vessels from approaching any killer whale within 400 metres in the coastal waters of British Columbia, extending from Campbell River to just north of Ucluelet, which expands upon the 200 meters under the <i>Marine Mammal Regulations</i>. This approach distance under the Order is in place year-round and was most recently implemented for a period of June 1, 2025 until May 31, 2026. This measure contributes to the recovery of the Southern Resident killer whale population, and directly mirrors the exceptions and provisions set out in the <i>Marine Mammal Regulations</i>.</para><para>A provision under the Interim Order allows the Minister of Transport to authorize commercial ecotourism and whale watching companies to view non-Southern Resident killer whales no closer than 200 metres.

Throughout the year, there are multiple channels through which the government demonstrates this commitment. These include budgets and economic updates (or statements), the estimates documents, which provide detailed projections of planned spending, the Public Accounts of Canada, which include the official annual audited financial statements of the Government of Canada, and the Fiscal Monitor.</para><para>Published by the Department of Finance, the Fiscal Monitor is a monthly report that provides an overview of the federal government’s consolidated financial operations.

As detailed therein, the government posted a budgetary deficit of $43.2 billion for the April to March period of the 2024-25 fiscal year, compared to a deficit of $50.9 billion reported for the same period of 2023-24.

Although governments often face economic uncertainty, the current situation differs when it comes to the scale, complexity, and immediacy of the risks, and the way they interact. Given the significance of these developments, it would be premature to finalize a multi-year fiscal plan without a clearer view of how Canada’s most important trading relationship will evolve in the near-term.

In December 2024, Canada established its 2035 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction target of 45–50% below 2005 levels. The Government of Canada is pursuing a number of opportunities to help ensure that Canada remains firmly on track to meet our 2030 and 2035 targets and be net zero by 2050.</para><para>Canada’s industrial pollution pricing strategy uses strong financial incentives to ensure that large polluters reduce their carbon emissions. In March 2025, the federal government adjusted the federal carbon pollution pricing system by eliminating the consumer-facing carbon tax, effective April 1, 2025. The federal government will be considering broader amendments to the <i>Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act</i>, and intends to engage provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples and stakeholders on changes to the minimum national stringency standards for carbon pollution pricing, known as the federal ‘benchmark’ criteria.</para><para>Changes would focus the benchmark on ensuring industrial pricing systems continue to maximize emission reductions and advance the transition to low carbon technologies, while protecting industry against competitiveness and carbon leakage impacts. The desired outcome of the benchmark criteria is that systems continue to be rigorous, effective, and reasonable. The review will consider opportunities to strengthen industrial carbon markets to allow them to provide the incentives required for major decarbonization projects across industry.</para><para>The Government of Canada is committed to becoming the world’s leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. This will require the creation of an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change. To support these policy aims, the government will launch a new Major Federal Project Office to expedite approval times from five to two years all while upholding Canada’s world leading environmental standards and its constitutional obligations to Indigenous Peoples.</para><para>The government is taking action to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector, which is a major contributor to Canada's economy and its largest source of GHG emissions. The <i>Oil and gas sector greenhouse gas pollution cap</i> will help ensure the sector invests in technically achievable decarbonization to be a low emissions source of oil and gas. The <i>Clean Fuels Regulations</i> will also play an important role in reducing emissions from the sector and drive reductions in the transportation sector by accelerating the use of clean technologies and fuels, and support sustainable jobs in a diversified economy.</para><para>In the electricity sector, regulations are in place to phase out unabated coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. Furthermore, the government is committed to phasing out the export of thermal coal by 2030.

They are an integral part of Canada’s strategy to meet the growing demand with affordable, reliable and clean electricity and to set the country on a path to net-zero.</para><para>Since 2016, the Government of Canada has invested over $160 billion to drive investments in clean tech and decarbonisation, which includes a $93 billion suite of clean technology investment tax credits to attract investments in electricity, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and clean technology to attract investments in critical minerals, nuclear energy equipment, energy storage, and zero emissions vehicles (ZEV). For example, the $8 billion Net Zero Accelerator initiative under the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) provides support for large-scale investments in key industrial sectors. SIF is also managing $1.5 billion in funding for the development of critical minerals projects. This includes supporting domestic capabilities required to manufacture technologies necessary for clean power generation, energy transmission and storage, ZEVs, and any product that reduces negative environmental impacts through efficiency improvements. Further, the $15 billion Canada Growth Fund supports projects that: reduce emissions; accelerate the deployment of key clean technologies and scale up companies; and strengthen key critical supply chains. This refers to the clean tech sub sectors that are covered under the clean tech ITC. i.e. critical minerals, nuclear, energy storage, and ZEVs.</para><para>The Government of Canada recognizes that workers must be at the heart of the country’s efforts to transition to net zero. The 2022 Fall Economic Statement introduced $250 million over five years for new measures to help Canadian workers thrive in a changing global economy, including a new Sustainable Jobs Training Centre. The Government also released an interim Sustainable Jobs Plan for 2023-2025 to enable the creation of good, middle class jobs across Canada.</para><para>Through continued collaboration with provincial and territorial governments, engagement, partnerships, strategic policies, and thoughtful investments in clean technology businesses, large-scale decarbonization and workers across the country, the Government of Canada will continue to advance its commitments to decarbonize and grow a resilient and prosperous economy, in which no worker or region has been left behind.</para></paras></section><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): The Honourable Julie Dabrusin</signatory><paras><para>Climate change is affecting the safety, health, and quality of life of people throughout Canada.

As investors, consumers, and governments increasingly base their decisions on environmental sustainability, taking climate action now is also a critical economic opportunity.  </para><para>The Government of Canada recognizes this reality, and since 2015 has taken significant, ambitious steps to reduce emissions from all sectors of the economy, protect the environment, spur clean technologies and innovation, and help Canadians and communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  In 2016, the Government of Canada developed the <i>Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate C</i>hange, in collaboration with provinces and territories, and with input from Indigenous peoples. Building on this national effort, the Government of Canada released its strengthened climate plan, A <i>Healthy Environment</i> and a <i>Healthy Economy</i>, in December 2020 to deepen emissions reductions across the economy, create new, well-paying jobs, make life more affordable for households, and build a better future. </para><para>In 2021, the Government of Canada adopted legislation that committed it to achieving an enhanced 2030 emissions reduction target of 40-45% below 2005 levels under the Paris Agreement, along with a commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The <i>Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act</i> (the Act) provides a durable framework of accountability and transparency for Canada’s climate action and path to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Act requires the Minister of Environment and Climate Change to set subsequent targets for 2035, 2040, and 2045, at least 10 years in advance. The Act also holds the federal government accountable as it charts Canada’s path to achieve net-zero emissions by establishing a transparent process to plan, assess, and adjust the federal government’s efforts to achieve our national targets based on the best scientific information available. </para><para>As the most recent deliverable under the Act, Canada established its 2035 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 45–50% below 2005 levels. This milestone reinforces Canada’s commitment to tackling the global climate crisis and will shape our next decade of climate action, aligning environmental progress with economic growth. In setting the target, the Government of Canada was informed by the best available science, Canada’s international climate commitments, Indigenous knowledge, and the advice of the Net-Zero Advisory Body. The Government also invited provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, stakeholders, and interested Canadians to share their thoughts on climate action and the appropriate level of ambition for Canada’s 2035 target via an online survey and oral or written submissions. The Government ensured the priorities of Canadians, including household affordability, remained at the forefront in setting Canada’s realistic and achievable 2035 target. </para><para>The Government will work closely with partners across sectors to develop the 2035 Emissions Reduction Plan by December 2029. This plan will outline concrete policies and initiatives to pursue our objective, much like the <i>2030 Emissions Reduction Plan</i> (ERP) did for the 2030 target. Canada published the 2030<i />ERP<i />in 2022, which laid out the next steps to reaching Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target, including a suite of new mitigation measures and strategies, and built on the foundation set by Canada’s existing climate actions.   </para><para>A price on pollution for large emitters will continue to be a pillar of Canada’s plan to build a strong economy and greener future. It is a system that is fair and effective. Industrial carbon pricing is one of the most important greenhouse gas emission reduction policies in the government’s comprehensive ERP to bend the curve and meet on Canada’s emissions trajectory. Carbon pricing systems for industry are also designed to keep costs low to protect against competitiveness risks. </para><para>The Government of Canada will always defend the national interest and the best interests of Canadians. That includes protecting the health and safety of Canadians from the impacts of climate change, while growing our economy. Taking action to fight climate change is positioning Canada to be a global leader in the clean economy of the 21st century. </para><para>The Government of Canada remains committed to phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation. In 2018, Environment and Climate Change Canada finalized regulations that require the phase-out of unabated coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. Most provinces have already phased out coal power, and Alberta recently completed its phase-out of coal power in 2024, several years in advance of the federal requirements. Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia also recently renewed their bilateral equivalency agreements with the federal government on the coal phase out.</para></paras></section><section type="original"><title>Response by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</title><signatory>Signed by (Minister or Parliamentary Secretary): The Honourable Tim Hodgson, P.C., M.P.</signatory><paras><para>Canada is at a pivotal moment in history. Faced with global volatility, disrupted trade relationships, and a changing environment, Canada must act decisively. We must strengthen Canada’s economy while doing our part to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C by lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this new global context, our goal is to make Canada a clean energy superpower as well as a supplier of secure, reliable, and low-carbon energy and natural resources.</para><para>To achieve this, the Government of Canada is making significant investments to attract private capital, accelerate innovation, and build a competitive low-carbon economy. This is anchored by our government’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Key investments to mobilize our economy include Canada’s Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits, which will support major investments in clean electricity, clean manufacturing, clean technologies, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture projects. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is also advancing the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program to deploy clean electricity infrastructure and modernize and strengthen the electricity grid.</para><para>Policies such as an industrial carbon price and a suite of new clean investment tax credits provide the policy certainty required to attract significant private capital. Moving forward, Canada’s new government will rapidly advance projects of national interest to build the strongest economy in the G7. This includes clean energy projects that create jobs and prosperity for Canadians while reducing Canada’s emissions to fight climate change. Under the <i>Building Canada Act</i>, projects will have to follow Canada’s strong environmental standards and ensure robust consultations with Indigenous Peoples.</para><para>NRCan is also focused on expanding access to global markets. Meeting the world’s growing energy demand requires displacing higher-carbon energy sources. Canadian conventional energy, LNG, and electricity–produced under the highest environmental and labour standards–offer a clear value proposition to our partners, enhancing their energy security while increasing the resilience of Canada’s economy. Investments in carbon capture, methane reduction, and clean technologies are bringing more Canadian energy to market while advancing our climate goals.</para><para>Our energy future also depends on scaling up emerging sectors. We are supporting hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, geothermal, biofuels, and integrating our electricity grids to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable power across provinces and territories. This strategy requires true collaboration. We are working closely with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, labour, and industry leaders to deliver results, ensuring national projects reflect regional strengths, respect Indigenous Peoples and the environment, and deliver long-term prosperity. Economic reconciliation will be key to unlocking the best projects, and, as a first step, we have doubled and expanded the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program to increase Indigenous communities’ access to capital.</para><para>A clean electricity grid is the backbone of Canada’s economy and our core competitive advantage. It allows us to attract investment, decarbonize heavy industry, and create good-paying jobs. Canada is building a clean, reliable, and affordable electricity system. This work is supported by $60 billion in federal investment, primarily through Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits and targeted programming. We have built a strong starting point, as approximately 85 percent of our electricity already comes from non-emitting sources such as hydroelectricity, wind, solar, and nuclear power.</para><para>Our government is moving forward with the <i>Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act</i>. This legislation will create sustainable jobs, strengthen industries and communities in every region across Canada, and support a workforce with the skills, training, and tools to benefit from these new job opportunities. The Act supports the government in creating sustainable jobs for generations to come.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="39352">Climate change and global warming</Term><Term Id="94379">Green economy</Term></IndexEntries></Petition><Petition Id="13525049" Title="451-00008 (Justice)" TypeId="19" ParliamentNumber="45" Session="1" SignatureCount="45"><Parliament>45th Parliament</Parliament><StatusId>223</StatusId><StatusName>Government response tabled</StatusName><StatusReachedDateTime>August 20, 2025</StatusReachedDateTime><PetitionNumber>451-00008</PetitionNumber><Title>451-00008 (Justice)</Title><PetitionerFirstName /><PetitionerLastName /><Sponsor><ShortHonorific /><FirstName>Alex</FirstName><LastName>Ruff</LastName><Constituency>Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Constituency><Caucus>Conservative</Caucus><ProvinceCode>ON</ProvinceCode></Sponsor><PresentedDateTime>May 30, 2025</PresentedDateTime><GovernmentResponseDateTime>August 20, 2025</GovernmentResponseDateTime><CertificationDateTime>December 17, 2024</CertificationDateTime><Prayer><Petition><Title>Petition to the Government of Canada</Title><Prayer><Para>Whereas:</Para><Para><ul type="disc"><li>The Jordan Rule, set by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2016 to address systemic delays in the Canadian legal system, has had unintended consequences.

The federal government acknowledges the concerns that have been expressed with the framework established by the Supreme Court of Canada in the decision of <i>R v. Jordan. </i>Our government is actively looking into these issues and will continue to work with provincial and territorial partners to identify ways to promote timely access to justice and improve the experience of victims in the criminal justice system.</para><para>The federal government has undertaken significant legislative reforms to reduce delays in the criminal justice system. Former Bill C-75, <i>An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</i>, which received Royal Assent on June 21, 2019, introduced extensive reforms to reduce delays and modernize the criminal justice system. These reforms included the expansion of judicial case management powers, the reclassification of over one hundred <i>Criminal Code</i> offences, the expanded use of remote appearances and virtual hearings, and several additional measures to make the criminal law and the criminal justice system clearer and more efficient. Moreover, former Bill S-4, <i>An Act</i><i>to amend the Criminal Code and the Identification of Criminals Act and to make related amendments to other Acts (COVID-19 response and other measures)</i>, which came into effect on January 14, 2023, helped to address the challenges faced by criminal courts that were caused or highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It built upon the changes made in former Bill C-75 to allow the use of technology to facilitate remote appearances by further expanding the ability of accused and convicted persons to appear remotely by video or phone in most criminal court proceedings.</para><para>The federal government has also made operational improvements to enhance efficiencies in the criminal justice system. For example, Budget 2024 committed $440 million over five years, starting in 2024-25 to support access to legal aid in the criminal justice system to help reduce court delays. The federal government also filled a significant number of judicial vacancies across Canada and increased the capacity of superior courts by funding the creation of new judicial positions (e.g., 22 new positions under Budget 2022 and 13 new positions under Budget 2021).</para><para>Criminal justice system delays are a multi-faceted problem that requires concerted action from all orders of government. While the federal government has taken action to enact legislative reforms and introduce operational improvements, the provinces and territories also play a critical role in addressing criminal justice system delays given their responsibility over the administration of justice. Provincial and territorial governments have a key responsibility to ensure that their justice systems are adequately resourced so that trials can be held within a reasonable time and <i>Jordan </i>timelines can be respected. This resourcing has direct effects upon the overall experience of victims of crime throughout the criminal justice process.</para><para>The federal government is actively working on these issues and will continue to monitor these important issues and collaborate with provincial and territorial counterparts to address delays, improve efficiencies, and increase access to justice for victims of crime.</para></paras></section></content></document></Response><IndexEntries><Term Id="63674">Backlogs</Term><Term Id="38746">Criminal justice system</Term><Term Id="176856">R. v.

Transition interviews are available to all releasing Regular and Reserve Force CAF members, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) members, and their families.</para><para>Implemented in 2015, Enhanced Transition Services (ETS) is a joint CAF/VAC process to support medically releasing CAF members and their families during the transition process. ETS provides coordinated and integrated support from CAF and VAC, including joint case consultation and coordinated case planning to ensure continuity of care for CAF members and their families during the transition process. </para><para>In 2024, the new Military to Civilian Transition process was implemented to address a gap experienced by non-medically releasing members.  It provides a standardized, personalized and professional transition process for non-medically releasing members and their families.  </para><para>Recognizing the need for immediate mental health support, VAC implemented the Mental Health Benefit on April 1, 2022. This benefit automatically qualifies CAF Veterans who apply for a disability benefit for mental health conditions with Mental Health Benefits coverage. Veterans can receive coverage for up to two years of treatment for conditions such as anxiety and depressive disorders, or trauma-and-stressor-related disorders.</para><para>As Veterans transition to civilian life, finding a family doctor can be challenging. VAC launched the Veteran Family Telemedicine Service on January 3, 2022, which provides access to online medical visits to recently transitioned Veterans and their families living in Canada. Registered Veterans and their family members can connect to a Canadian-licensed doctor online in minutes, at any time of the day, 365 days a year.  Budget 2024 outlined an additional $9.3 million investment over five years, starting in 2024-25, to extend and expand the Veteran Family Telemedicine Service pilot for another three years. This initiative will provide up to two years of telemedicine services to recent Veterans and expand coverage to family members.</para><para>VAC remains committed to making the application process for disability benefits clearer and less of a burden for Veterans, regardless of how they choose to apply (online or on paper).</para><para>Veterans can obtain assistance in preparing their VAC applications from VAC Field Operations staff at each of the 38 Area Offices, or from staff at the 27 Transition Centres.

Provinces and territories, for their part, are responsible for the protection of workers and occupational health and safety at ship recycling facilities.
